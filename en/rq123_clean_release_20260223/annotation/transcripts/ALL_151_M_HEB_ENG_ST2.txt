there was a guy who was blowing bubbles under a tree the bubbles got so huge that he was so excited about it he decided to create different shapes of bubbles then he decided he want to make a huge long bubble that would look like big snake so he blew up a snake and then he blew up another bubble so the snake would be afraid of it he boo a bubble in the shape of a cat that would try and eat the snake but then an octopus was blown to a bubble and he tried to eat the cat and then the guy blew up an elephant shape bubble which tried to eat the cat as well so the kid saw all the things that were happening and he decided to blow away the elephant away from him and he decided that that was it and so he decided to do another bubble thingy under the tree and pour away all the water soap he had because he was tired of making all these bubbles and the last horse shape bubble
