there was a funny looking bird named jim
he found a hat on the ground
so he wanted
to just grab it
and put it in on his head
so he did it
and he was very happy with the hat on his head
then another funny looking bird mike saw him
walking with his hat
he wanted that hat
so he laughed at jim
and jim was a
jim was ashamed
that mike was laughing at him
so he threw away the hat
and ran away
and mike was happy
to grab the hat
and he took it
and put it on a tree
and make himself a nest
but jim was watching him
and he saw
that mike a sitting on his hat
he he went
and grabbed the hat
and put it it on his head again
but all of a sudden there was a little bird on jim's head
