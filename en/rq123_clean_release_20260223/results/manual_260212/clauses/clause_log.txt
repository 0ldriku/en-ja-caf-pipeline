  subordinate_advcl         | because he just couldn't take it any longer

  parataxis                 | she took fancy in in this hat almost immediately
  parataxis                 | and that was here plan
  subordinate_acl           | to make jimmy the bird
  nonfinite_xcomp           | get rid of this hat
  subordinate_advcl         | so when jimmy left
  parataxis                 | she took the hat
  coordinated_vp            | and went home
  parataxis                 | she finally found what
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | she's been looking for such a long time
  subordinate_advcl         | because it was a time
  subordinate_acl           | to have babies now
  coordinated_vp            | but she couldn't quite decide
  parataxis                 | where her nest will be so
  subordinate_advcl         | when she found the cylinder
  subordinate_ccomp         | it was so convenient for her
  subordinate_csubj         | to have a nest
  subordinate_advcl         | while jimmy accidentally sore her
  parataxis                 | and he was furious
  subordinate_advcl         | cuz he finally understood
  subordinate_ccomp         | that penny made fun of him
  subordinate_advcl         | not because the head was funny
  coordinated_vp            | but because she wanted him
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to get rid of it
  subordinate_advcl         | so she could have it
  subordinate_advcl         | so it occurred to him all at once
  coordinated_vp            | and he felt very frustrated
  parataxis                 | and was determined
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to get it back
  subordinate_advcl         | so he went to the place
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | where penny sat
  coordinated_vp            | and took the cylinder from her
  parataxis                 | she took by surprise
  parataxis                 | she never expected anybody
  parataxis                 | jimmy looked angry
  parataxis                 | and he really wasn't the one
  subordinate_acl           | to argue with
  subordinate_advcl         | so he just took his hat
  coordinated_vp            | and put it on
  parataxis                 | but what happened
  coordinated_vp            | is that there was already a baby in the nest penny's baby
  coordinated_vp            | and so the jimmy jimmy found
  subordinate_ccomp         | that there was something wrong
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that he has something on his head
  subordinate_advcl         | and so when he took off the cylinder
  coordinated_vp            | it turned out that the little bird
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | who was crying mama
  subordinate_ccomp         | was sitting on his head
  parataxis                 | of course he couldn't be angry anymore
  subordinate_ccomp         | seeing how penny was happy
  subordinate_advcl         | how she greeted him
  parataxis                 | how glad she was
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | and after all the cylinder that he found
  coordinated_vp            | served a very good purpose
  parataxis                 | so though he felt frustrated at the moment
  coordinated_vp            | but nonetheless she got a baby and a good nest for that time
  coordinated_vp            | and now he's gonna have a hat
  parataxis                 | so that was a little story about the incident
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that happened in the woods between jimmy and penny two frien

  parataxis                 | he felt so peaceful
  coordinated_vp            | and nobody disturbed him

  subordinate_advcl         | so at first they were just bubbles small balls
  coordinated_vp            | but then he thought
  subordinate_advcl         | what if i try a little bit harder
  coordinated_vp            | and he tried to liberate
  coordinated_vp            | and it turned out

  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that is pretty exciting
  parataxis                 | billy thought
  parataxis                 | what if i can almost anything
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | i want
  coordinated_vp            | and so he decided to try
  subordinate_advcl         | and whatever he tries to make
  coordinated_vp            | he always manage
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to do that
  coordinated_vp            | and so he had a car now and sheep and a butterfly shoe cups 
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he wanted
  parataxis                 | so that was really fun
  coordinated_vp            | but then he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to try something different
  parataxis                 | he was blowing
  coordinated_vp            | and blowing and blowing bubble
  coordinated_vp            | and then it turned out
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he made a big serpent
  subordinate_ccomp         | the snake looked
  subordinate_advcl         | as if he were alive

  subordinate_advcl         | looking at billy
  coordinated_vp            | so billy decided
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he would make somebody else
  subordinate_acl           | to chase this serpent
  subordinate_advcl         | because the serpent looked unfriendly
  coordinated_vp            | and billy just wanted
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to make sure
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he's safe
  subordinate_advcl         | so he made an even bigger cat
  coordinated_vp            | and for a split second he felt afraid of what
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he has done
  parataxis                 | he did not expect himself being so good at this
  coordinated_vp            | so cat broke loose
  subordinate_advcl         | to chase the serpent
  parataxis                 | and serpent disappeared
  subordinate_advcl         | but then when billy recovered
  coordinated_vp            | he thought
  subordinate_advcl         | maybe if i could make cat
  subordinate_ccomp         | i could make even something bigger like an elephant
  coordinated_vp            | and he did it
  coordinated_vp            | and how happy he felt
  subordinate_ccomp         | he loved elephants a lot
  coordinated_vp            | and now he had one of his own
  parataxis                 | it was big and white
  coordinated_vp            | and it he started
  nonfinite_xcomp           | chasing the cat
  subordinate_advcl         | so after that the cat disappeared
  subordinate_advcl         | so billy was thinking of what else bigger than elephant
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he might make
  subordinate_advcl         | so to give elephant a competitor
  coordinated_vp            | but he could think of nothing
  coordinated_vp            | and so he just had
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to say to his friend
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he'll probably be the last and the most powerful animal
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he would make
  coordinated_vp            | and so they had
  parataxis                 | to part they had
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to say goodbye
  parataxis                 | because none of their creations could be around him for any 
  subordinate_advcl         | because the wind was blowing
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | so everything he created
  subordinate_advcl         | inevitably was blown away
  parataxis                 | and they've wind now was even stronger and so
  nonfinite_xcomp           | whatever he want
  subordinate_advcl         | that he tried
  coordinated_vp            | he could manage nothing
  parataxis                 | so at the end he decided
  subordinate_ccomp         | he called this afternoon
  nonfinite_xcomp           | and decided to go home
  subordinate_advcl         | so he throw away the bubble soap
  coordinated_vp            | and walked home
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | but what he forgot
  parataxis                 | was the dragon
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he made at the very beginning
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | who waited
  subordinate_advcl         | to see
  subordinate_advcl         | to tell him goodbye

  coordinated_vp            | and now one day he was looking at the bubbles
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he was making
  coordinated_vp            | and he started
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to see different figures in it

  nonfinite_xcomp           | to take the shape of a snake a very big and angry snake
  coordinated_vp            | and john got a little scared about that
  subordinate_advcl         | so what he thought

  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that would scare the snake away
  parataxis                 | so he started blowing
  parataxis                 | and blowing and blowing
  coordinated_vp            | and a cat came out of it
  coordinated_vp            | and the cat looked at the snake
  nonfinite_participle      | the snake got

  coordinated_vp            | but then john got a little worried
  subordinate_advcl         | because that cat was so big and so angry
  subordinate_advcl         | that he was scared
  subordinate_ccomp         | the cat would get angry at him too
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | so the solution he thought
  subordinate_ccomp         | would be the best
  parataxis                 | was to blow another thing out
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that would scare the cat this time

  coordinated_vp            | and blowing and blowing something very very big
  coordinated_vp            | and out of it came an elephant
  coordinated_vp            | and the elephant got this angry look in his eyes
  coordinated_vp            | and he looked at the cat
  coordinated_vp            | and the cat didn't even do the slightest meow or anything li
  nonfinite_xcomp           | and started running away
  coordinated_vp            | and he ran away
  coordinated_vp            | and the big elephant chased it for a little bit
  subordinate_advcl         | until it was gone
  parataxis                 | and john was so happy about that
  subordinate_advcl         | so he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to pray little trick on the elephant
  coordinated_vp            | and he started
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to blow something very small
  coordinated_vp            | but that made the big elephant very scared
  parataxis                 | john was making little mouses out of his bubbles

  nonfinite_xcomp           | it started running off like crazy

  nonfinite_xcomp           | and start walking with the hat on him
  parataxis                 | another bird saw him with the at
  subordinate_ccomp         | on the other bird started
  nonfinite_xcomp           | laughing at him
  subordinate_advcl         | because he had a hat on
  coordinated_vp            | and so he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to throw the hat away from his head
  parataxis                 | the other bird just sat there in front of the hat
  nonfinite_xcomp           | and decided to take it with him
  coordinated_vp            | and put it on a tree
  coordinated_vp            | and sit in it
  coordinated_vp            | and create a nest from it
  parataxis                 | then the owl saw the bird in the hat nest
  nonfinite_xcomp           | and decided to steal it away from him back again
  subordinate_advcl         | when the bird saw
  subordinate_ccomp         | the owl do that to him
  parataxis                 | he was really angry
  nonfinite_xcomp           | and decided to put his litte birdie on his head that's it

  independent               | there was a guy
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | who was blowing bubbles under a tree
  parataxis                 | the bubbles got so huge
  subordinate_advcl         | that he was so excited about it
  parataxis                 | he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to create different shapes of bubbles
  parataxis                 | then he decided
  subordinate_ccomp         | he want
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to make a huge long bubble
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that would look like big snake
  parataxis                 | so he blew up a snake
  coordinated_vp            | and then he blew up another bubble
  subordinate_advcl         | so the snake would be afraid of it
  parataxis                 | he boo a bubble in the shape of a cat
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that would try
  coordinated_vp            | and eat the snake
  coordinated_vp            | but then an octopus was blown to a bubble
  coordinated_vp            | and he tried
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to eat the cat
  coordinated_vp            | and then the guy blew up an elephant shape bubble
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | which tried
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to eat the cat as well
  parataxis                 | so the kid saw all the things
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that were happening
  coordinated_vp            | and he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to blow away the elephant away from him
  coordinated_vp            | and he decided
  parataxis                 | that was it
  coordinated_vp            | and so he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to do another bubble thingy under the tree
  coordinated_vp            | and pour away all the water soap
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he had
  subordinate_advcl         | because he was tired
  subordinate_advcl         | of making all these bubbles and the last horse shape bubble
