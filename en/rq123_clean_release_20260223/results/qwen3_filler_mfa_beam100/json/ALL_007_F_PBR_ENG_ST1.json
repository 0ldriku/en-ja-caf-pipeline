  "transcript": "One day, a brown feathered bird was walking along the forest. When all of a sudden, he found a hat lying on the floor. He looked at the hat and thought it looked good, so he decided to take it for himself and started wearing it all over the place. A few days later, he was walking along the same forest when a bird far away started to look at him, and it looked at him with a strange glance. And the brown feathered bird didn't understand why the other bird was looking at him so much, so he started to walk towards him. Once he reached the other bird, the other bird started laughing and laughing and laughing to the point where he was falling on the ground and was still laughing. The brown feathered bird started to get very angry because he didn't understand what the other bird was laughing about. He thought maybe it was about the hat. He thought he looked good in the hat, but apparently the other bird didn't. So he decided to throw his hat away and he walked away as fast as he could. When the other bird saw the hat on the floor with no owner or no one around it, he decided to take it for himself. So he got the bird at the so he got the hat on his beak and he started walking towards his home. Once he got to near his old nest, he saw a little tree with some bushes and decided that he would move to that tree and that the hat would be his new nest. So he found a cozy spot in the tree, put his hat down, and went inside it and slept nicely and warmly. About a week after that, the brown feathered bird was walking around the other bird's house when he saw him. And when he saw that the bird was using his hat, he got very very angry because he wanted the hat for himself, but he threw it away because the other bird was laughing about it. So he went up to the tree, looked at the bird and said, \"Hey bird, what are you doing with my hat? That was my hat and you took it from me.\" And he grabbed the hat and started walking and took it for himself. And the other bird was so scared because he was sleeping and he was keeping the hat warm for a very very special reason.And then the brown feathered hat, just to show that he owned the hat, he put it on his head. And the other bird started to get very, very angry. And now all of a sudden something really strange happened. The brown feathered bird started to feel a little thing moving under the hat and starting to pinch his head. And when he took the hat off, he saw that a little baby bird had just born underneath the hat. And that's why the other bird was so angry about it.",
