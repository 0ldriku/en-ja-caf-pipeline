the boy was sitting under the tree playing with his toy bubble maker making all sorts of bubbles like car like whales and everything that you can imagine but once he he thought of making a snake as he made it the snake i came to life and was angry at the boy and wanted to attack him but then the boy came up with a new thought of making a lion and then as he made the lion the lion skirt away the snake and so he was safe but now the line was a problem self so the boy this time made a made an elephant and the elephant this time chased away the lion but now for the elephant it was enough to make a small mouse to chase it away and after the boy made the mouse the elephant was also gone and after playing with all this stuff the boy happily just burst the bubbles and pour out the water of the bubble maker to the ground and left the left the tree but as he poured a water to the ground a dragon came out of the water and he was sad because the boy didn't play with him and so who knows what would the boy do if the dragon was there
