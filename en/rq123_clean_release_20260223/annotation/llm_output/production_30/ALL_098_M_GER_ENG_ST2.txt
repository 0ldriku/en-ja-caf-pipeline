there once was a boy
sitting under a tree
making soap bubbles
and the soap bubbles turned bigger and bigger
and turned into animals like kangaroos and cars and lots of other things
he was very excited about it
and then one soap bubble turned into a snake
that moved around
and threatened the boy
and turned into a bear
and once again into
and the bear was chasing the snake
and it also turned into an elephant
and the boy was very happy and impressed by everything
that was going on
and in the end he threw away all his soapy water
and walked away
while the snake was still around
