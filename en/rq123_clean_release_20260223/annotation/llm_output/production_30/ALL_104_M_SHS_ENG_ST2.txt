there once was a little boy
who found a can of bubbles
and started
blowing away
the first thing
he made
was a kangaroo
and then he went crazy
and made all sorts of big interesting bubble shapes
then he got bored
so he decided
to make animals
the first of which was a snake
which after done looked really scary
and so the little boy decided
to make something else
to protect him from it
it ended up being a bear
which ended up
scaring off the snake
but then he had a bear
and so he came up with something
to scare off the bear
so he blew an elephant
and the elephant ran the bear off
but then he was stuck with an elephant
and so he made a little mouse
to scare off the elephant
and then when he had nothing else
to do
he popped them all
and poured the rest of the bubbles on the floor
and threw away the bubble can in the trash
and as he walked away
out sprung the loch ness monster from all the bubbles
he had left on the floor
