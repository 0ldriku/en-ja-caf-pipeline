billy loved to go to the park to spend his time there and his favorite occupation was to blow some bubbles he felt so peaceful and nobody disturbed him so he was just blowing and blowing and after all it was fun so at first it they were just bubbles small balls but then he thought what if i try a little bit harder and he tried to liberate and it turned out that he could blow he could blow kangaroo that was pretty that is pretty exciting billy thought what if i can almost well anything i want and and so he decided to try and whatever he tries to make he always manage to do that and so he had a car now and sheep and a butterfly shoe cups anything anything he wanted so that was really fun but then he decided to try something different he was blowing and blowing and blowing bubble and then it turned out that he made a big serpent the snake looked as if he were alive and it was a little bit angry looking at billy so billy decided that he would make somebody else to chase this serpent because the serpent looked unfriendly and billy just wanted to make sure that he's safe so he made an even bigger cat and for a split second he felt afraid of what he has done he did not expect himself being so good at this so cat cat broke loose to chase the serpent and serpent disappeared but then when billy recovered he thought maybe if i could make cat i could make even something bigger like an elephant and he did it and how happy he felt well he loved elephants a lot and now he had one of his own it was big and white and it he started chasing the cat so after that the cat disappeared so billy was thinking of what else bigger than elephant he might make so to give elephant a competitor but he could think of nothing and so he just had to say to his friend that he'll probably be the last and the most powerful animal he would make and so they had to part they had to say goodbye because none of their creations could be around him for any longer than a minute because the wind was blowing so everything he created inevitably was blown away and they've wind now was even stronger and so whatever he whatever he want that he tried he could manage nothing so at the end he decided he called this afternoon and decided to go home so he throw away the bubble soap and walked home but what he forgot was the dragon he made at the very beginning who waited to see to tell him goodbye and to play with him but billy completely forgot about him but he'll come to the park to the same spot next time and they will play again
