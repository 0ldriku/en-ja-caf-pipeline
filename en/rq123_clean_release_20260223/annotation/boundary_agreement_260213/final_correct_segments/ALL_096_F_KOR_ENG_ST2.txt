there was a boy
named brian
who really love
to make bubbles
he bought a bubble can from a weird weird man
he said
it is a magic bubble
when we when you make a bubble
and think about things
that you won
then the bubble you can make the bubbles
what you really want
and what you really want to need or have
so one day brian want
to meet a kangaroo at first
so he think about kangaroo
and started
to make it
and it really happens
he was so happy about this bubble
so he tried to think
and make as much as possible such as car ships dolphins and butterflies and et cetera
about a few days later he he wanted
to make many many animals
as much as he can
so first huh he made a snake a little bigger one
but it was too vivid
and it was
it feel like
it's alive
so he just blowed it up
and then he made a pig
then the then snake was actually
he made a snake an also with a pig
that the snake look so sad
because he does not care about snake anymore
because he made pig for new an then
the pig was not a big actually
it's a
it was a cat very very huge cat
and the huge cat was chasing snake
then he made another one
which is bigger than a cat
that is a giant octopus and the giant octopus like
when actually it was not a giant octopus
it was a elephant
and the elephant also chasing the wild cats and actually their bubbles at
so they're all just disappear
so when the boy tried
to make a new one instead of elephant
the elephant look so sad
because the elephant wanted does not want to disappear
but that was the destiny of bubbles
so they just disappeared too
and the baby boy brian realize
that the old bubbles are disappeared
and he doesn't
he feels some left out
because he does not have friend anymore
so few days later the baby boy brian just pour the bubble cans to the ground hey
and he just throwed it up
he just he just throw the bubble cans to the trash can
and actually there there was a dragon
was waiting
to chasing the elephant
and the baby boy brian didn't know that forever
