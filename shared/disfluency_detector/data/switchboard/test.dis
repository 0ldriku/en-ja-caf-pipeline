uh the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and monthly budget the only thing i do now is uh put the data into quicken i don't know if you are familiar with that
um i've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it
and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic so it really helps with that
well actually we haven't had to uh until just recently i guess we've got a a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way so
we needed to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that we tried a way try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that
um sounds good yeah i guess we're we're just at the point uh my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's
a lot more interesting trying to uh find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to uh do it you know kind of enforce the savings
but uh it will be interesting to see
that sounds good but uh uh i was just curious what uh part of the country
oh okay
uh cincinnati actually i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people are uh getting involved in this but
uh well that's interesting i'm uh uh actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading telecom digest or was there another
oh okay yeah that is how i got it as well but uh
yeah it will be interesting to see what
it would be interesting to see how the data base so well i guess we're talking about the experiment
uh probably need to try to get back on the topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures i guess
you know we could talk about some of the long range goals and
uh well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
uh i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement
i mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent and now it's uh now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh it's a real shame from what we had before uh because we're
yeah i have some friends of mine who use quicken and uh i've considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date
so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken at least for now
yeah well it's similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we will get behind like you say but uh it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced
well how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances
yeah well that's pretty good if you can do that i know i have a daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point but uh we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away
for college so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction
in the fall and then the money that i will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund
well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time
so it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and sickness and
travel and that kind of thing
oh stockton
how about you
uh a colleague of mine at uh work got some information over uh the computer network called internet
and he just forwarded that on to me and uh it sounded like it would be an interesting project
to participate in so i
sent back mail
well what other long range goals do you have besides college
uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home
that's true yeah
that's true i never thought of that yeah
that's true until they get over that hump
of whatever it is they're dealing with
they really are they don't like to keep them
longer than a week
what do you mean
yeah that's true
yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own
yeah uh i would personally like it if my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help that's not always possible
but uh to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible
that's true yeah
but i think nursing homes can be good it just depends on what kind they are you know you need to check them out ahead of time
yeah that they're
who know what they're doing with that
yeah well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet
but uh she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years and then she decided that uh she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden she's very independent so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country and uh she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook
right some support and then there's also uh sort of a wing for those people that do get sick and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now and then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her
yeah sh-
no she loves it she has a great social life and she travels and uh it's in in the very in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh i i hope that i have something like that when i get older
oh definitely it's
well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
uh sometimes it is there is no alternative
uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around
so sometimes it's not an alternative
and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home
uh especially if if it's after an acute illness to get over a or to rehab after uh an illness
sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time
because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're
really able to
so there is some good to it
uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the fam-
well the families do not necessarily uh know what to do with them and they don't want to take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home
so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think
that's true
i think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's
because it's not economically feasible even to
put them in a nursing home
so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either medicare or insurance to cover it
yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties
uh i know some unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have i guess it's alzheimer's or where
they wonder or or uh confused or have some mental problem
and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around
and you need people who are trained for that type
of problem
yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think
gives her a little bit of her own independence
but she still has uh a security there
that's right and i
i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones
who are more active
so it's not sort of like uh uh
a sick place
yeah i i think i think the uh
i think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly
uh person who's going in and the family that's going to be uh effec- effected by it
and uh you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance and sometimes
the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're
so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm
uh i work for a fairly large company it's got eight thousand people
and uh we do have health insurance we don't have four o k- one k plan stuff like that but we do have like retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that
it's not bad
god i don't know it's probably a long time i'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years thirty years
huh well i guess what we have is like a f- what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money you know put in your paycheck
yeah well it depends on which company you work for i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan d deductibles are really high it's like fifteen hundred dollars but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're f- relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much amount of money you know so the- it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and and take a loss what- whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual
really you mean not even your your your car insurance
oh that's too bad
yeah uh well i don't know i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh time off would be nice i only get two weeks
oh that's nice we don't get them till till your seventh year of service till
you get an extra week
yeah it's uh
uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable it's a lot less stable than it used to be they used to have job security crap but now they don't
yeah it's the bell corps which is uh
so i don't know it's it's uh no longer so that's what i think it's still based on the old model of and and now they don't uh
yeah but they no no longer
i don't think so
uh hearing a lo- there's always they're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security
oh i don't know we don't we haven't been doing layoffs we've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management and uh i don't know what they do for those people
some of it yeah
there's too many manage too many chiefs and not enough indians but
well it's about three hundred and fifty people i guess that's not large compared to some but it's big enough
and they have a they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and i wish they did
you know they have a four o one k but i put all the money into it
they don't add anything what about you
oh that's a pretty good deal
now how long does it take for your contribution to vest
yeah the place i work at's health insurance is kind of expensive it's like hundred bucks a a month or something
for a family
yeah we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh they'll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses i can send in a uh can send in a request for payment and they'll uh and they'll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld that's pretty good you know it's uh it saves a third off on taxes or something
yeah i guess uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan and uh one of my kids was in a car accident and uh
i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is
well it it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here and and i had a high deductible on the on the uh on the c- car insurance and then s- you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it
oh well
yeah yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks
that's a long time
yeah especially in the kind of engineering job i'm in you know companies don't stay afloat that long and and they
so you work for bell or something like that
a lifelong job security telephone
pioneers of america all that stuff huh
is it i mean does it they must have pretty good severance though huh
mean the the the management they get rid of
oh they they put
i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted
um and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
have you ever served on a jury before
oh okay
uh what sorts of cases were they
so were they criminal or civil
oh okay
what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
so did it become
uh but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority
what was what was the other case that was also civil
oh didn't really even count
yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know a jury eligible age for very long
um and uh i did get one summons actually at one point but i declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do at some point um but i i haven't uh one one thing that i i think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh i i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well especially sort of
how wha-
uh you thought it turned out pretty well
oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on
um that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or
so it work- it did end up working out pretty well
the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of um you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind so
oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and
he hadn't made the payments
uh so they were suing to get it back
uh i have twice
it was a pretty wild experience
they were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
they were civil they weren't
they weren't any criminal
uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people
so it was they and uh the one changed his vote at the end
so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
but it then became unanimous
the the other case was just traffic the and you know it was seat belt law
and it it didn't even hardly
go through so
yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
i wouldn't think that it does
i mean from from my from what i experienced in them it didn't you know it didn't turn out the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go
yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me
i'm not used to it not being organized and i just assumed that it would have been
that's about what it was
yeah they well they picked one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have
yeah it ended up working all right
i i don't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what's going on
yeah the the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer
that which was uh seemingly their property
it was on his property
so they came to get it
and then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off
so and they are it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart
so they left it there
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
so they were suing him for the money and you know there's no way they could because it it was the moving company
uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper uh the houston chronicle and sometimes i'll read like the uh wall street or the new york times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it uh how about you do you uh mostly
get things from t v or
oh that's interesting you said computer networks uh what uh what sort i am fairly knowledgeable of
uh okay that's interesting
oh i-
is it
is it the a p news wire or is it something that is uh a little bit different from that
uh okay so that's that's interesting okay yeah i've had i had access in the past to uh uh the a p news wire and i thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news uh i've never used the dow jones news wire but uh yeah it uh do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
in what way in like in sort of like uh qual- uh quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
yeah well you won't offend me so go ahead and say
yeah like a liberal type of bias
yeah yeah
they they generally make mistake on anything technical at least
yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
yeah yeah
huh that's disturbing
i haven't really noticed them doing that but whatever again i don't watch t v news that much now if i had access to c n n i would watch t v news more uh i don't you know but i don't usually
yeah did you did you think that c n n well the gulf war coverage would be kind of uh an abnormality i just wonde- i guess i would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say c n n t v news compared to the three networks uh you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever but i i guess you wouldn't you probably if you just watched it during the gulf war that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much
i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the wall street journal
most every day
uh well well dow jones for example have the cause the
uh news wire and it's picked up and actually available uh at my office so it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure and it's sort of by category for example
so i can read a certain business or topics
well uh it's similar to that but it's dow jones which is uh the wall street journals news wire
uh well actually not uh i do uh follow uh uh uh i don't know how to how to describe it so i'll say a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense it's a weekly
but uh but not uh not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things i'd like to say that however uh that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
uh i think that it i think that it has to do with uh i personally think uh i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh ther-
that there's a strong bia- there's a strong bias in the media
yeah absolutely uh after all who who writes people who are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal uh a liberal field
at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm an expert in i find their descriptions to be wrong
and it
that's right well even if it's not technical if it's uh some social thing or whatever it doesn't matter if i am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think i'm not expert in it they're telling me lies
uh i think both uh by deliberate i uh i mean mistake mistakes of omission or uh or uh biased toward a particular view point
a particular liberal
view point that they have
so uh uh to give you an example uh we will go out of the printing media i know of cases where uh we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you
which is sort of like a deliberate bias
which is which is rather disturbing i mean he does that
yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and it was i did during the gulf war and it was addictive
yeah well during that small sample i would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks radio television programming
so if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news
you could do that by uh turning on c n n and you
anyway uh
what do i do uh at the moment it's under chaos uh right now i'm just uh i i don't really have a budget per se i'm i uh it's called living within your means
you know which means at the moment paying off the visa bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse
uh but uh no i don't really have a budget at the moment uh but i have uh i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i don't usually don't exceed that unless i unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that then it goes through the moon so
yeah so uh what do yo-
so you can afford to get a house
so what do you and your husband do
are you really
no kidding
i see
overseas where would you be going
really how long would you be there
with with what church
oh yes yes
i uh i know who they are they uh they have an office uh in in costa mesa as i recall
there there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them so uh are you uh are you uh active in translation
true true enough so uh what what uh what languages do you speak besides english of course
in france
must have been terrible the uh was it henry macon said that the the uh language was like a man slowly bleeding to death so they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die and i it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that free style english is just takes on
how about you what do you do with your budget
yeah that's true
yeah that's sort of a problem
we're trying we're trying to uh so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is so not much on that side of it to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but
yeah we'd like to do that some day
we have this dream
but we don't know how long it will be a dream
we we're kind of real we're real happy that we don't have any debt but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this uh economy right now so
we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
we're missionaries actually
yeah uh-huh and uh it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
africa nigeria
about four years we're career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year
uh we're with wycliff bible translators
yeah they could very well and
uh we will be i was over over four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need
and uh came home and got married and we will go ba- back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators well i always wanted to do translation but as long as i was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did
you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten
and how to do market stuff but in about uh about five i guess i can do better in it and my french is pretty good but it's uh french so uh i'm terrified to speak in uh
in france yeah because they're real snobby about their language and french is street french and i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when i came home and french to somebody and he paled and said uh i'm not going to tell you what you said so since then i have refrained from speaking any french
so in
i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
uh guy uh some of my things i i'd like to have a short work week
you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau-
okay so i just press one then right
okay ready
well well right now i i'm just a student i only work part time but i've work in the job force before
and forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it seems like saturday you get get off but sunday you're getting ready for monday and if we get have a
if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job
and then that way everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that would make a bigger market we'd have uh more recreation people would have time to do it there would be less of a stress level we'd have we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons you know less police force
it it that's that's a possibility
one one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance is that the small business can't can't offer health insurance
and it it's too costly and what what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have x amount of users in it okay so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and and things like that what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money
for one particular it's called a a group well what will well what happens then is that they cancel because they just can't cancel an individual so they they have to cancel just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
so what they do is that that they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job i'm i'm an engineering student
and i work for my instructor and i'm i'm not a typical student i'm i'm older i'm i'm in my thirties okay
and so i have a lot of job experience and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose
but in in the same token it's a very really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and
and one of the things that i i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that i i just really can't deal with that so
what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
yeah that's just great you have what you might call knowledge power
you know when when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist but if you're a person who that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company
and you get more benefits so that's where i i i'm like i'm into computers too and that's one of the things that i've found in any one one of these jobs and anything i've done is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're you're not going to uh you know be let go be one of the last ones to let go anyway
so what i
oh okay
okay we can start off there let's just get started
if you don't want to you know uh talk about it now and then
be bored when we get to it
so so you think uh i think that a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty-seven hour work week how about you
yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear and that
right so
well well i do wo- uh research in computer science and i've just been doing that for a few years now so
uh i my job has most of the benefits i want uh what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like but uh you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of uh they also a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education like i i get night courses that they they'll cover right now and that's really good yeah
well what were you saying
oh okay
uh well i haven't really been up to date on a lot of music i've been in school and i haven't really gone out
and bought any or listened to much on the on the radio except for classical and uh
well i like most of them except for country music
no i think i i might like dancing to it but i don't like listening to it
uh-huh wh- what's the old country music like
oh okay
that's the kind you like you mean
oh oh okay
well i guess i i like the blues a lot and i guess you could say it's similar as far as
the kind of ma- the way they do it
yeah me too too i guess i like except heavy metal and uh most rap i don't like yeah
oh okay
okay yeah
oh i i really haven't listened to that
well uh i used to a long time ago but since i've started back into school now i haven't really done that much i've been pretty busy uh
but uh so no i haven't i you know i used to go out and dance a lot but i don't do that anymore either so
i've just been real busy with with lots of other things
well no i i went to school and got a degree and then i worked for awhile and then i just started i started back a year and a half ago changed directions
yeah how old are you
oh okay all right
yeah and uh i didn't really start getting into music until i went to college because uh my parents didn't really have music in the house put it that way
so i'm always behind i'm i'm not i'm never really up to date on all that stuff but i know what i like when it's uh when i like a sound a certain kind of sound yeah
yeah yeah
oh really
oh well
well i i do play the piano you know
but uh i i like the uh early seventies late sixties rock
kind of stuff the old stuff and uh
bri- what kind of music is does what

i think i've heard summer of sixty-nine
okay i'm not i'm not very good at remembering the uh
titles yeah but i can remember this the song yeah
no i don't watch t v much at all
yeah so
do you like uh like someone recent like enya have you ever head of her she's not rock but
she she's from ireland
and uh she's gotten some uh she's been on like the top ten i guess or whatever
she she did
okay i i think we're started now
uh do you want to go ahead and start
well you like classical music
uh i like classical music i like rock and roll
i like country and western
uh i i like all kinds i like i like different things about each one of them
oh you don't like country
the the kind of country i like is kind of the older country music
not the not the kind like kenny rodgers and stuff like that
that's uh that's a little bit to uh it's such they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing you know what i mean
oh like like hank williams like the old hank williams even even hank
williams junior is real good stuff the kind that
uh this stuff
makes you cry it sounds so sad i mean you d-
yeah som- sometimes i do i mean not all the time
yes and i
i i do too i also like jazz
yeah you're you're about like i am then i i can't
watch m t v anymore i used to love m t v

and and i liked uh aerosmith and
led zepplin and uh
you know and uh jeez who else is there van halen
now i like i like groups like that but when you get uh i i even like guns and roses some of their stuff
but uh some of these groups now like slaughter
some of them are just really rough so so you went to school then in i'm surprised you didn't go to to any pa- parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff or
oh i see are you married at all
well how old are you
okay so you you were out of s- you went to school for awhile and quit then went back

the same age then
oh rea- were they religious
uh i see i
my parents were very musical my mother had
a piano
in the in the house my father likes uh country western music
he's from uh west virginia so that's what he grew up listening to
and he's always liked it and and you know he's probably about fifty-three years old now so he grew up like in the late fifties and
you know when they had that the elvis presley music and stuff like that
and that kind of rock and roll so he likes that and my mom always liked that kind of stuff my mom likes like uh doris day you know
she always had those these old doris day records and stuff like that though
so you know i grew up listening to that stuff
but uh i could see why you went uh you know i could see why you were kind of sheltered
i guess from from music
oh okay
oh okay
yeah so do i
do you like uh like v- van halen or anything like that or how about brian adams

d- do do you get cable
oh okay that's that's
you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow
but uh yeah i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos
i like watching that kind of thing it's
no i haven't heard her
oh okay
oh really
hello ann
uh the other day i attended a conference here at utah state university on recycling
and uh i was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places
and uh they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
well it's not too new
oh they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a
but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and uh things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and and uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print he was talking about uh the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print
and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
yeah we're doing some here in in cash valley the community here
there's uh we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard
and make it into insulation and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it
and there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill
and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
and it's more than even paper or something like that there is more energy in it per pound or whatever
well that was he didn't deal with that
he just said burn it
he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical
yeah well real interesting
uh not too much uh i got a bit actually
hello chuck
uh i didn't think that was a new revelation
right so what what is the e p a recommending now
right that's a that's a common problem though that it seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose
well that's good
right there has to be uh a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
and uh i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that
oh really
well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but
what about emissions
no well it's interesting i bet that was a good day at the yeah conference then
did it change anything for you
so uh you know my feeling is that uh it's really being used today it it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
right because y- you you've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
uh and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent uh for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the c- crimes that would be eligible you know really care
right i mean it's kind of like the aids phenomenon you know i'm invulnerable i don't need to care about this you know i i i'm
never going to get caught
yeah one one
way or another
yeah but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself
you know so that you know the the question is you know the other qu- problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent you know there are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops i'm sorry guess we killed the wrong guy
right you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think i- is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works
yeah and you know the i i think that you know and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to bush is you know well where are we going to impose d- you know it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
and again i don't thing these people care *typo replace thing with think they risk their lives every day
yeah and and you know uh especially now i live in in massachusetts you know w- w- we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
so you know but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like texas or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way
i think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it
because you know
oh yeah
it's mainl- lot of blacks also a lot of young people you know a a a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i've seen
and you know i i think when you listen to like the uh the the victims families and things they're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it i mean my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the uh the victim's family the only thing that should really i mean obviously if someone of mine who has close died i'd probably feel differently but
you know th- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
right i mean the
right and the the other thing is that you know i was reading through a book on uh geneo human geneo research
and there more and more things like schizophrenia and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
so if someday we can go to jeff dahlmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society
you know you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions
society made me do it
right i think i've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
well that's committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or
yeah b-
yeah but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh jeffrey dahlmer do you want by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again
if you kill him there is not that possibility
yeah i don't think he could ever redeem himself but
in some cases yes
yeah it's it's yeah once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it
oh yeah yeah it's a- the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused
yeah and there there they seem that the profit marg- uh drug dealers the profit margin's so high that yeah
the the risk is almost not there
yeah well
it's also i used to live in georgia and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related
and ethnically related
right and that and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution
you you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family
yeah well i i think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions i never like the uh
the defense
well i never liked the uh insanity defense
well anyway i uh i uh oh yeah i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way
oh you're ann hi but uh anyway i uh lot of lot of interesting procedural things i think would be a good be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject t- tonight which in some i guess criminal courts the
yeah th- the one of which was uh something something that's been going on because of the rodney king trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race uh
yeah well they they uh the the people that the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case
is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that
they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here
um it's in ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that
yeah it was everywhere
so you know and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
exactly you know um the you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true but on the other hand it's it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict
uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether
or not the person whether or not the evidence says
that there's enough
they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic uh here we go again folks
kind of stuff
no no i you know on on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing
these people beating the heck out of this guy um
yeah um
i don't know you know and and again there's something else tha- you know there was a uh something else along those lines there was a girl out here named latausha harlins i don't know if it's it's got it's got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the rodney king problem um a girl walked into a korean owned store and uh they she had a dispute black girl
she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her
yeah and and oh of course they you know the criminal case went up and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was
it was just she gave her no time in jail you know all of these things and then oh there's we have these we have people wondering around to- with petitions trying to get the judge
yeah yeah
yeah it would make it would make life easier
uh i'm ann
criminal courts yes
oh really
i see
i can't i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one
well that videotape was just horrible
oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
based on fact right
how interesting oh so what's the prevailing thought within the community
i mean you know what the news media is going to make of it but what about the community
oh my goodness that can't be good for los angeles either
oh exactly
unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like los angeles you're going to have it just about anywhere
there *listen
but that's that's interesting
what about the judge who's hearing the case is he going to be impartial is he going to
be a go- a good adjudicator
oh really
oh my goodness
to get that judge recalled i would think
huh that's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences
it would
you would know the whole world would know what you were facing and then it's a matter of of deciding
okay uh before a couple of years ago i had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes and it was uh more like a funeral home i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home and uh then i had to do some volunteer work here in tyler texas and i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re- resort uh i have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics
yeah so uh she she's real interested in uh what ann richards has been doing she's ann richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes and i don't know you wouldn't know anything about a texas governor
okay ann richards is our governor in texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and uh my sister's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing
uh-huh it sure is and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive because
cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older
oh yeah
right my grandfather passed away several years ago i was much younger but uh he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life and someone visited him every day my grandmother did but uh if she couldn't someone visited him every day it was in a very small town nursing home
and uh people didn't get paid much there at all they didn't care about what went on
they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores
and uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people and then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for forth any loving care for them
right and nurses get so worn down
oh sure and they feel
they feel pretty helpless
is it uh like a retirement center
how's he handling that
oh sure there wasn't anything like that that you could do in florida
well that sounds good
i've heard the name and that's about all it goes
yeah that's one problem with the the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
uh you know they don't always have their full wits about them
they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on
and it can be pretty sad i've got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
and you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in florida my in- families was up in maryland
and the other part of her family was up in uh new york state
and you know it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was uh you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke
and you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in
you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work
which means it's you know very difficult for some- you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time
and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home
which makes it you know it's a necessary evil i think
yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford
to put in the uh care that they need
cause it's you know an elderly person can you know it's like a newborn baby you need
to have twenty-four hour care
uh answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points
uh-huh and you know there's a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
and it very very hard for them to accept that
we just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility
more of a retirement home he's got his own efficiency apartment
and they provide one meal a day
and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him
but they do have you know group activities going on
uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in florida
uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from florida up to maryland and
it's it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else
well there was stuff like that in florida but
drug testing in the work place um i've been tested a few times just before pre- drug employment but that's about it i've never had random drug testing
oh really
oh they do with alcohol
they do it with alcohol
oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
huh that's interesting
what type of field of work are you in
oh in the oil business
okay and you work in the office around
yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags
for the cars and we work around a lot of explosives
yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know they're working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous
now do they fire them or do they
oh wow
huh that's i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure what the
that's right but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but i'm not sure if
if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits
you could time it just right
i know one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous
huh that's true
uh-huh do they give any limits on alcohol or is it
pretty good pretty good so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh *listen
yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but i've never been uh never had to do it
yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and i think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's
yeah yeah they they they'll check for alcohol
no once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing
yeah it's a
i'm in the oil business
yeah i work in the office so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment
uh-huh uh-huh
well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on
yeah yeah well i i i agree i think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff
you know if it's as long as it's not abused uh you know random you know as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it
well see this is it this is where i start having my problems with my company i work for a private company and
and the policy is something like see if i can re- state this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling
but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
so it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos
yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it
yeah yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job
but uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know it's not i guess i ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem
uh so i gue- you know i guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the a -s and b -s are going to be in and next week
c -s and d -s are going to come in
yeah right right
yeah well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff
you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case
uh i don't remember to tell you the truth i don't think they do um well they must i mean gee whiz that just shows you how much i've been paying attention because i i really don't know
i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in houston that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company
oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs
okay karen you- you're first
yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment
and then also in the administrative association so there is a progressive path but not being in the say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
uh like really
yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances
uh so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh
job security yes
yeah we are seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive lay offs
uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world
in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do
yeah and institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily where it's needed it's where it's most expedient which
well in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's
often the lowest support type roles
so we
it's very easy
right because it's support people that are providing
the speed for it
well the uh that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess yeah because my perspective is from an institution uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness
because the limitation for reward is very severe
but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for i guess in- innovation although he you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
but uh i think there is uh it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts
yeah you end up being your own person
and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and
you know you really
yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves
okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement you know not to get in like in a dead end job
and plus for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental
they're also important
are they like pretty much train for a specific job and that what i hired for and then i just very little variation from that
well you know that's interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you work you mean security job security
uh that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what november i guess
but uh it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time
uh-huh no doubt
expedient yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar where where you know it cuts back the most
oh see yeah
yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know
yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time well those people aren't there anymore
yeah but so what else do you think is important
i think probably in a small yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere
probably where as in a bigger corporation i think you're just a number you know
whereas yeah in a smaller i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know
okay so uh with the issue of trial by jury uh i actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because i thought there were cases where uh i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve
well i'd be curious as to what the uh requirement for a an acquittal is and i i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal but i don't know whether you need an a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit
yeah i'd agree with that but i've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although i've been out here and registered for i guess about five years
well the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that you know after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
and in fact i'm not sure that that's any more uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than than anything else
yeah i'd
read one book i think it was calls trial by jury of all things that uh
went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at what had at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing the verdict uh you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
yeah once
yeah actually i i agree that that's an interesting thing i i believe that's a for for civil suits it's not unanimous right but for for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law
yeah i actually thought i'd read that too and that's why i phrased it that way
i wonder the difference yeah the difference could be that for uh state if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require but i don't know what the the laws do you think that that's an unreasonable uh requirement that they be unanimous
yeah that that would be an interesting change it was also allow the uh idea that if you had one person who was uh very disagreeable that i mean it it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because uh the fact that it's w- the the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt uh criterion that it uh increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment so i i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
yeah actually
i i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do i would like to do that i've been out here twenty some years and i've been called uh three different times but i've never actually even made it into the the jury box
and because there have always been a number of people and and i've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions uh i yeah i also think that would be really good i
well the the one thing that i know does seem to happen from people i've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure
going on and that that uh peer pressure and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
yeah i i understand you you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude uh to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response i think of the movie uh twelve angry men
you ever seen that movie
uh yeah it's it's it's exactly that situation where uh it's henry fonda and it's eleven to one and he's the one i i believe he was opposed to the conviction and uh and he held on and
hi so do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have
do you watch a lot of t v to get the news then
well i read uh i get a bunch of different things i get a newspaper every day and i try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that and i look through uh i get a newsweek every week which i i pretty much read that cover to cover and i as far as you know that satisfies most of the short term news i get uh don't watch much t v don't have enough time and uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know they might give you a little blurbs like
this happened or that happened and that's about all i ever hear of it uh but most of my news probably comes from newsweek and for the longer term i i read uh like scientific american and and uh readers digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they the news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material
yeah it is it is more in depth less broad well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth and uh it is it is more sig- it is more just significant information you know it is the big events not the little events
not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of broad and main you know
yes or they're making making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news
uh i get kind of bored watching t v actually when i watch the news on t v because
it goes so slow and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting
yeah that that's about what it ends up being listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something
yeah i think they're about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind and uh uh what what kind of uh what kind of news normally interests you i mean what do you what what do you find interesting
versus what do you find boring
i think it will uh they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence but we've yet to see it and th- it's real short term yet though i mean it's only been three months or something like that
since that happened so
but they like to tell us that it's going to be important
i think it is too
yeah i i think that's a possibility uh it we might also be helped though because it it will be easier to do business over there too
for the companies that already have a presence over there and uh i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it
came time
yep because once you're in there then you can easily expand but getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult
and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know
like england doesn't want to do one thing and and sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
and some of it i mean is i'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified
before they
open up their borders to everyone
uh what is the uh do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that
against your will
yeah at least you guys have a remote control
it's sometimes better to not have one of those course you can always mislocate it
or misplace it i mean not mislocate it but misplace it and
uh actually no because because i'm in school i i kind of miss out on most of the current events i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it
uh i don't watch a lot of it but that's the on- basically that's my only major source of information
what about what about you
and it's more in depth
i know where they're just trying to fill in
i know i do i do too
yeah you may find one little uh news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it
yeah actually y- you mention newsweek i i i do like uh u s news and world report i don't get to read it as much as i like but that's i think that's a good magazine
right now trying to keep abreast of uh what's going on in europe you know with all the u s s r's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and you know european community coming together
that's going to affect our uh economy quite a bit
oh yeah
i'm i'm pretty sure it is because uh
once once europe becomes unified and uh their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be uh kind of hurting
yeah definitely
oh yeah
so they have a toe hold i good toe hold
yeah because when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist so
yeah i i can understand their viewpoint they're just they're starting off their economy's a little bit weak so you want to
get established before they
yeah totally
actually i'm not really into sports my roommates are so unfortunately i forced to watch quite a bit of sports
yeah we have to fight over the remote control
okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
uh-huh well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard
oh yeah
i see
uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an h m o
um so that's in my opinion that's get- that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage
that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment
and uh at that time i immediately joined the h m o and i never really so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the h m o and uh
you know for me it's worked out real good
uh-huh yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh georgia tech in the
research branch and i guess another one that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a benefit
yeah getting a lot of breaks
between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with
um and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
oh yeah
are there are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits
uh i would say the medical uh group insurance area
as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members
yeah i think i work for a public school system district
and uh so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs
but overall um i've been pleased with it over the years
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out
although it has not disturbed me any
how about yourself
right yeah
our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the h m o and um i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something
and um uh i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i
i have to say it really works but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for
you know those people
right but if you you know have a family and and um everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it
i i'm sure it would be very stressful and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor
but your benefits are not as you know good so uh
oh all right
i do too are you talking about like spring break and
it it really um i don't think most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am a secretarial executive assistant but i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long
frankly it is just texas has really um you know they want everybody educated no matter what it costs uh and it it would be just we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and
i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff
what do you do there
well that's good yeah i would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little luke warm or something
and um it's good that they allow you that
it um as i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get many days off and uh we all look forward to it
that's the only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the
time i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs
and uh i've just continued to uh stay there
okay i guess it took so i guess the recording has started now
i served i was in the air force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one
was it civil or criminal
a grand jury or
i see
uh-huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that
that's a science in itself
uh-huh i see
because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and
so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
wow i bet that made him happy
yeah oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury
that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh wayne kennedy smith trial uh a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's a simple majority you know rules
probably on capital i don't know we weren't we we the two that i were on had to do with drugs
and uh we were uh unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases
uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off- special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and
all they could do was testify
so have you ever served on a jury
yeah i finally served on one last year i've um been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet
and i finally was so it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring *listen should i be it
uh it was uh
uh it was uh well let's see it was municipal court
so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks
so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors
and then it was always exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room
uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh i'd be questioned uh for empaneling the jury and
they kept uh dismissing me
course they don't have to give a reason but it's just
whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so
they ask all kinds of wild questions
yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions and i think part of it was they didn't uh they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more so
yeah that was
probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i don't know
well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got empaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty
so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that we weren't were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate
so the whole thing had to be tried over again
yeah yeah it was uh it was funny the uh i ju- i i don't know i uh i didn't uh uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate
i uh i i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed
so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure
uh it must have been six
yeah well let's
see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and
uh it was too circumstantial
do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore
of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um i i like the statement made by cuomo cuomo i believe is um he's he's governor of new york but uh he's uh against the death penalty but um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife and that's but but even even in that circumstan- in that uh uh situation he would b- he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh keep him from doing the doing the things
right exactly
see i don't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together or are they is it a penal institution is it is is it designed for punishment um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment uh perhaps not in the manner that we do it but but it in in theory it fits in in reforma- system in a reformatory i mean if you if you put someone to death you obviously
can't reform them
i don't think it's done i don't think we run it as a deterrent i mean people say that but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks
every once in a while and if we really w- if it was really seriously going to be a d- deterrent i would think that it would be public i mean i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it if someone ever if you know like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here at the you know
that's a good question uh there would be a point there was a point where i would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed but uh since i've become a parent and since i've seen uh things like jeffrey dahlmer i really have to question that i really uh i i can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
and uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment uh
oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
uh a- and that was the thing that uh killed dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion
uh a gut level reaction and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill
i think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one
that's true
uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and i really don't uh agree with that i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well i was about to kill and dismember this person but oh if they catch me they're going to kill me so i better not do it i i just
don't think that uh that it works that way
well i i don't know if that would really work that way or not uh there's a lot of violence
um are you working right now
what kind of what kind of work do you do
wh- is that how you heard about this thing
uh-huh me too i work at uh the georgia tech research institute
um i'm a co-op student so i work and go to school about halftime and uh i really don't have any job benefits to speak of we're kind of um i don't know they just kind of forget us on that end we don't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really so
what about you
uh they do that i think if you're uh research here then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and i think that um they might you know pay for that
pay for the classes and stuff but i know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage you know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you want to finish
you want to
yeah they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if you want to get your masters and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so
that will probably help out but
do you get any kind of health care type stuff
yeah i think
i mean that's pretty that's a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my i'm still covered on with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works but
it would definitely be something to look into once i get my own
they have
well the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean i'm learning and stuff because
i'm at you know in school but
there's there's some weird law where uh uh student employees working for the government
don't have to pay social security tax
that's about
five percent right there so
that's about the only real bonus
i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid real you know because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to you know pay an extra five percent
or so
oh yeah
help a lot
yeah see around around here it's like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors
there's not there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from
uh yes i am i'm working in the computer science department here
uh at c m u
uh i'm doing basically system system design
work and uh implementation work for the speech for the speech group
uh here
actually through electronic mail
right so it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away
at at this point
well um t- i- i'm research stuff here now so what they they have uh um okay benefits package it's not quite as good as industry but one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um and they pay for
you know pay for the classes so
carnegie mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit
if you want to
do it quickly
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah yeah so i i don't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary i'd you know i
yeah we we do we have to contribute a certain amount uh to it
and it's kind of split between c m u and
and you know the employee
yeah and it's also right now it's uh the like everywhere else uh here in pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly
that's a whole other topic
to begin with too but yeah but it's you are right i i i really agree that that that's pretty important
now that's a big win
yeah yeah that's
i figured for and they've just raised the um income caps on social security to the point where
you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying
paying that as well yeah well if you could call it a benefit that c m u i mean i- the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies
um so that's that kind of helps out in terms of
you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry
you know in case
you know in case you ever need to bail out
yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way
but have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested or
i once too so
yeah i had it during a job interview and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them
to do this and i'm just like well uh i'm not even going to think much about it
if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before
you've gotten to know me
yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work
rather than on these other factors
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or
i tend to to view it even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
uh and i don't really
well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
um i don't really think that it's uh too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
well i think i think we i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
uh like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane
but uh i i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
uh yeah i have been
i mean i was very offended by by the whole process
i mean it's very humiliating and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you
right that's that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just you know i did i i was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and it's i just and i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know i really the other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or
or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work i mean during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
that's exactly right
and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees lives outside of work you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all
uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries
or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me
okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway uh well i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me and
uh i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year
no i work with them all day i'm in computer science yet i
i do everything on paper
uh i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers
yeah that
yes it's pretty straightforward it's almo- i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making
you know fancy budgets it seems like if you're getting to that level y- you're not in real good control
actually i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills
because that way it's a record of everything and i don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else
because they come in at
the end of the month
yeah i guess if that's
if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do
do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or
well that's good to know
i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it
it seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it
yeah just the form
yeah and a lot of them
i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer y- too much stuff like that because i want to make sure that that i i keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention
and it seem
we have the same thing
uh-huh do
you use a computer
yeah mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when uh he was a marine he went to saudi arabia and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance
you know so they come in i pay them and that's it you know that's about
the extent of it you know i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and
uh just real careful with the money you know what little we have so that's what i do
uh-uh you know i mean i i i've never liked credit cards
and a lot of debt you know you
buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done
you know so
i don't have
too many
i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them
you know it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person
it's like oh it's on sale let's go grab it you know so uh and if you don't have the money then use a credit card so i got rid of them credit cards
you know
yeah that was my weakness it wasn't bad i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just
learned that that wasn't for me you know
so but i self-employed you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so uh i keep
no it's not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and uh you know what it's going to have to go for that month and
you know it's not that not that hard not at all
so i always do my own income tax you know
do you
r- all you got to do is read a book i mean
read the little book they send you
fill in the blanks
and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get
someone to it's dumb i guess if you had some really complicated stuff but i don't so i don't mess with it
but i don't use a calculator either you know
i don't i don't have that mu- that many you know things to add up so
oh yeah
and we have a
i bank at n c n b here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in and like once every other week or so and i will uh check off what checks have cleared and
do you do that
you do too
and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have you know
i do that real often i do that so anyway
okay so what are what are your views on capital punishment
so are they currently practicing capital punishment
in your state
yes that's similar to georgia
that's probably true considering
yes uh i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if
right that would be the intent of it
well i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many
yeah if if the person who's going to commit the crime
knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment
uh i'm a research engineer i work uh f- with georgia tech
um that's probably true but i guess
there's other factors that
but p- p- pumping more money into the school system is a
good thing but it's not going to
oh i see
so that's a difficult situation
well that's probably true w-
um yeah i guess that's not an easy solution there's there's no easy
solution for that
i'm sure it is yeah
um yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't
going to solve a lot of problems but
i guess i am
for certain cri-
yeah in certain crimes
uh premeditated murder
crimes of that nature i think should definitely any mass murderer type individual
uh-huh well you always have castration
yes i read about that
i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is but on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain you know texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
and it's eating us alive budget wise and uh
yes we
do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed
yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody th- than it does to keep them
because of all the costs of the appeals and all that
you know
well i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people
you know who would see it
yeah but i'm not sure how successful that is
maybe yeah
what what kind of work do you do
um well see i'm a school principal
elementary school
and in a very poor section of town with p- predominantly anglo kids and i see kids already that are going to be criminals
in spite of everything we can do and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that i mean course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids we'd have fewer decisions to make
down the road you know
oh yeah
i'm not talking about just in the school system
see i'm talking about like in in uh i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared uh i know the institutions don't work that well but it's a bad day because i get all these kids through my office i have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids
five hundred of them are good solid kids and i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day
and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible some of them in the penal system
and you know you just see those kids going down the road now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them have already been in youth centers
and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action
i think that's one reason we have problems in schools uh and some of them are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do
but that's another subject but
anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has making a decision what to do with them
i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be
it would be money better spent than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard
that's true
statistically that's true
are you for it
i'm for it in
in some cases
what kind of crimes would you d- use it for
i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going
you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
well you know somebody elected that recently
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know
but uh
okay well um i used to work in a day care center
i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and it is they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in tyler who had two or three um centers
all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they're not expecting it
because they do do things differently when you're not around so
well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers
to every room um sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool
the problem i had was that they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left
um they one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other
you know he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know
what is your problem so um
right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room
the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that
you know they really did separate them well
it was just the teachers themselves
but yeah that they're not
yeah their system
right but their but their system was was great but um the you know the caring just wasn't there
the one woman that taught that did the babies i worked with her and she was fabulous
she loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and um you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know
yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day
and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care they're just there
you know going through this routine
which is lousy
yeah you don't see that much
that's cute
yeah that has to be with a day care center
i've never heard of that that's that's a new one
on me
well that i know wh- the things that we kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have
and and how many kids they have and how they break it up
because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
it it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them and then you know so we got our day care free
but they didn't have enough teachers and
did did they separate them by age group
because i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important
i- it sound yeah
it sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
affectionate people that they're they're kind of par-
may be parents themselves or something
yeah i i i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team
and we knew them from other associations but uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type
the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and
and i- it was kind of interesting to see that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it an-
yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called humpty dumpty play school or something
but they also did they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um you know obedience obedience was important
and you know so they you know they used uh oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
and it's it's one
uh i can't remember what they call it actually but y- you just stand them in front of a clock and you know it has a second-hand that goes around
and they have to stand there
um what's our topic
right right um
what do you do
i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in
oh sure
uh well no i can't really complain i'm a student um and i d- i work as a co-op at uh georgia tech research institute and uh i'm going to get back most of what i earned i mean most of what i pay in taxes and uh and uh
on- one of my parents is still claiming me huh
i'm sure
i went well i did work um just very for some time but i didn't make enough money to really make
too much of a difference right
no no i haven't
oh sure
uh-huh taxes
no no i haven't uh i uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition so uh i'm i haven't made use of that
everybody says that
um i haven't i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet actually um the the degree i'm getting is physics there's a different one for applied physics so i guess you could call it more straight stuff
than applied
i doubt about that are are is america i mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries
no i don't think so either
do we pay too much
well do we
my tax bracket is is pretty high up there i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket
and uh i think that we're paying too much because i don't have any children
and i pay a lot of property taxes
i don't have any um i don't you know i don't use an awful lot of city services it it you know
it's like i have to work m- i have to work all the time
just to make enough money to pay the taxes
and um y- there's so many people who want a a dib of the federal money
or the state money or whatever it is and i just sometimes many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes
how about you do you pay too much
well when you
when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world
it it changes quickly
um you look at your paycheck and you go oh my gosh where did it all go
um what kind of what kind of uh well have you pay a lot of in ta- have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you did you go directly from high school into into college
to worry about it
have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this have you like worked on political action committees or something like that
i uh i haven't done any of that type of work myself
um but every once in a while when i hear up here at at uh in d c area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the congress um congress has added too towards the members bank there you know there's a bank that they all bank with and i guess it went defunct recently
and one of the congressmen has has written in the last three years al- about a thousand bad checks
and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks
no interest no repayment schedule
and um it's causing quite a stir up here
because we're so close to d c anyway
it's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur
um i i i think we pay too much and i've i look at my paycheck and i make well let's see they take out in state and federal taxes
i think i pay forty-two percent
forty-two cents out of every dollar i make goes to the government
and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes
and they charge me all these others and it's just too expensive
i can't believe that i i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for
you know what i mean
do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
what are you studying down there
oh that sounds like a fun fun field
heavy science
are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that or is it more um applied physics
well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's
come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward
actually i don't think we are
um like like europe
um england
i know the taxes are a lot higher
but they do have socialized medicine and things like that
and um i know i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um they're talking or maybe it was on the radi-
i don't think anybody pays too little
do you get hit up for local taxes there
oh so y- y- you get the whole smorgasbord
well i i actually live in new hampshire
tax free or die
no actually there's no sales tax in new hampshire either
no what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything
the only problem is i work in massachusetts so they
they hit me up for the five percent there
yep but it well you know we it's only a state tax here no local
we've got a five percent sales tax
but uh the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even if i don't live here
but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
so that's not too bad
oh i i mean i i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty-one bracket
this year which was no fun
right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a
which is taxes
where you most people forget about them because you've g- you know you can't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year
but so you know and then you know like a five percent surtax i'm paying forty percent tax
yeah well i i mean i think there's some people there y- certainly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
you n- you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
than you're going to get out of private individuals but you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers
because jesse helms wants it that way or
you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or
you know is going in into into programs that you know yeah they are they are a fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the h e w services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them
you know like we
yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like v a hospitals and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
well be-
between him and reagan yeah
the great communicator
oh oh yeah they think
oh yeah and then they go and say i'm not c- congress they're the fault for it
but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in new hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget
well yeah then you lose half your jobs in new hampshire
you lose grotten connecticut goes so you know it's like you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes
so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
who aren't contributing
right yeah
and uh in our
but what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v- th- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates new hampshire constitution
d- for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use
no i would tend to agree very highly i think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it
yeah we sure do here in indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it
that's right we
which is probably pretty nice but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
there's no sales tax either
no i uh i really think that here in indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that that i'm just getting overtaxed
no that's
that's not any fun
yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste
that's right got to keep those farmers happy
right the- there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around
instead of real you know good programs
right and a lot of it's feeding that just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy uh the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the bush administration who has increased government expenditures uh beyond what any other president since world war two has done and yet
he supposedly
right right yeah
i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national debt are was created during the reagan bush era
who are suppo- supposedly fiscally conservative
that's right
yeah it's really that is the especially that defense cuts in the defense is really a catch twenty-two
double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's going to lower our national expenditures but then you're going to have people on welfare and they're not
putting taxes in
so that's that's really it's
i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these policies
that's right
okay um chuck do you have any pets there at your home
and what kind do you have
well we have a cat um he's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
oh uh how's the disposition of your siamese cat
well yeah he's uh he has been really aggressive uh especially towards my little girl for
some reason he's uh been so mean to her
we've had him for about two years
and he was so mean to her um right after we first got him so we had him neutered and and declawed and now he bites her he can't
scratch her any more he bites her
yeah yeah he has a couple of times so
but he's a very possessive cat he he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
and he's so funny he just follows my son around just like a dog
he won't even let my son shower
he meows and wants to get in the bathroom and while he showers it's so hilarious so he's quite a animal
yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know
because we just couldn't have him being
so aggressive towards the girl but uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him so
were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house
it is uh-huh we we tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with uh oh malamute and some other kind of mix anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home so we gave him up and tried
yes uh-huh we're in a house but we're in a subdivision
where we really can't allow the dog we couldn't allow him to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was it was
unfortunate so have you tried any other pets
oh my word
oh my word
and do they they just paper train it or something
yeah well rabbits are darling that would be fun if you could get them trained otherwise they're pretty smelly
huh-uh we don't have c we don't have cable
is that right
well i'd be interesting to watch
yes uh-huh elton
we live out here by it's by ogden it's north of salt lake city utah
and we really love it out here it's uh kind of country we're we're only about ten minutes from ogden
so we're kind of country but not too
no huh-uh do you
oh well see i'm getting so many calls to texas
oh well great yeah i've been doing it for about two weeks and uh no my
no my
yeah i do
i've got a male siamese about a year old here i live alone in an apartment and uh
except for the cat
how about you
well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature
and uh he's been neutered and declawed so
he's an indoor cat so uh that kind of calms him down for the most part
how about yours
and and you say you've had him how long
two years
does he bite her enough to draw blood
yeah boy i guess well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right
you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something
yeah yeah
is that the only pet that you have
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh
i see
no no i i live alone in an apartment and uh it's it's not that big that uh
although i've heard rabbits are pretty good
you know i saw something on c n n or on cable here
a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments
and in houses and they apparently uh especially when they're young when they bring them in
i guess
i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either
yep that's right
did you see the the c n n the the dog show uh
i see well they have uh uh a wesmin- they call it the westminster dog show uh i think it's in new york city at the at the gardens there once a year live
and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something
to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there
some of them are really beautiful too
so you live in utah do you
well do you all work for t i or for
yeah yeah yeah
this is the very first one i've i've talked to
so how do you get most of your current event information
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so
um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock
and then um talking with people and just hearing what's going on
just the regular channel
just channel eight
that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news
oh uh-huh yeah
right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically
you know if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
right and the news too it just doesn't um cover that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes
and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
i used to read every month a reader's digest
but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper
to find out what was going on but a lot of the times i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time
if they put it out in a video or on
not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it
i would do that while i was doing other things but
well i um they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information
well i guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics
i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now
right right
yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things
well see i'm going to school right now and uh
while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot and i don't watch t v as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it
while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network
um i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know
people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like
the macneil lehrer hour
oh really
oh ch- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public t v so it's kind of different
i think i think the uh i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
yeah exactly
uh-huh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can't get a full picture of you know
their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it
what kind of see i subscribe to like science news and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of or like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
but other than that i don't really read i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
oh yeah
well i remember back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
but uh
if they reported every if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour
but uh
oh yeah that's they start already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on the olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
oh really
that's going to be crazy that time of year here
but uh
i can't believe i mean they're they're stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over i guess people want to hear about it also big in the news right now is the braves because they're uh they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever
and they did so well last year
it seems like i don't know they way they do the newscasts i wish they they kind of separated it you know if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it but i don't have cable
-kay dave what kind of pets do you have
one rotten cat
i heard a laugh in the background
don't you like cats
oh yeah
that's odd how does he treat the other people
did he raise him or something
huh that's interesting
huh we have a a mutt
well we we named it hooper because that's where we got it from
uh some lady she uh a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house
and she use to work for a veter- veterinarian so she would spay- uh neuter them
give them all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but it's my first dog i've had and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone
while i go to work so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i am away at work
uh yeah right now it it is
it's kind of good training i mean we have been trying for kids but
right now we haven't had any but it's pretty good training i think really keeps her on her toes
uh my brother has uh we didn't do a lot with them uh i never felt like it was mine or anything you couldn't do anything
but i mean that did did more responsibility when its yours and not your brother's
that's what we found ours is uh like a cockapoo
i think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle
but it's a really good dog
i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something
is your cat a purebred
would you ever want a dog in the family
oh yeah
oh yeah
he just needed a lot of time
oh we have one rotten cat
yeah it's my son's cat
yeah that's the boys they know i don't like it
well i like cats this this cat is a uh more like a dog
yeah he's uh a one owner he likes one boy in the family and that's about it
just uh stays away or runs
usually but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around you know when he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing
he's he we bought the cat for him and so he's uh been the one that you know spent the most time with him
but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and you know they are
usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
so it's a weird cat
a mutt
so that is that is that kind of your child right now
you feel like
oh uh-huh
have have you had dogs before
well i just uh we've you know when i was growing up i had we always had a dog and we had mostly mutts well not mutts but mixes
you know like one or two mix and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
no no it's just uh an accident
from a frie- uh from my my son's friend down the street they're
their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and so
uh we i would we uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an alaska malamute and a labrador
and uh i should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids
when we got him and we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and it was a dog that we gotten and he was he was just too big
uh the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of jus- you know he was too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post
so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've there is a place out here uh called shorties lane out here in harrisville
and they have uh i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps
so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him uh cause he has had him for six or seven years we we've saw him just about a year ago and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away
and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life
just goes everywhere with him i he would have been a great great dog
well here in saskatoon uh much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people uh there are areas where we could uh actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then
on the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing
and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so uh it's fairly fairly extensive but then again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
well actually there's there's the opportunity for both
generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit and then i and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well
oh yeah uh i guess partly because of our climate here in saskatoon at least the majority of central uh well i want to say central canada but central canada tends to referred more to ontario and quebec
but uh we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing uh there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although uh scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds uh regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes
they have done it some uh but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers they are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries collects or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
uh some of the
hey steve uh they just uh they just started a recycling program here i think actually this is my first experience with recycling program but uh instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about uh i am starting to split stu- split stuff up the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there what are they doing up there
the the deposits only on like drink stuff
oh okay
so did they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you
oh okay
that's very cool you know there's a i heard about a similar program in new york city where uh a thing called like homeless incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ uh homeless i think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them up to a one lo- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and get more money to these people that desperately need it
do they do it with news papers as well
jimmy so how do you get most of your news
oh wow so when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
oh okay well i would probably be a junkie or s- watch c n n a lot but i don't uh i don't uh subscribe to cable
be- because of the poor service and also uh because well i uh i give to the united way and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
yeah i take away a uh addiction
oh something
well i
what what uh newspapers do you read
uh-huh for a while there i i i uh subscribed to new york times a- actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance well she was unemployed for a while so she you know really needed to look at the the want- help wanted ads
and so often they they tr- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspape- uh news
and i don't know new york times is okay but uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but
uh i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level but
i swear it's at least second or third grade
but i don't know uh i think if you listen to like n p r or something like
that's pretty good uh and i like listening to that on on uh when i get a chance when i'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because i
well mcneil neil- and lehrer i guess he's leaving one of them is leaving
uh they're they're pretty good too uh i guess a year ago you're probably watching c n n a lot right
had that invasion or whatever it is
uh but i i don't know i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype look at the the smith trial
i mean that was a joke
oh yeah the n p r doing that yeah i know i had uh some visitor and he was just in- just i don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it
constantly uh and i guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that but that's not really providing you news
it's it's more like a media event rather than
oh really that's kind of boring to me i think
yeah i guess that's true but one of the ways that i get information is uh every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing it's free inside the company it's called intellect and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really literally i've i've actually read the actual articles they're pretty g-
well i kind of uh i watch the uh national news every day for one i also read one or two papers a day and i'm a i'm pretty much a news junkie and i tune in to c n n a lot
uh every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news
uh-huh as opposed to paying for cable
uh overall i i the quality of the news you get o- off of most uh sources i would say is pretty low it's usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and that's one of the reasons where i why i try and get as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope but still you know hard to say
that what you've heard is what really is
well i read uh the local newspaper and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the chicago tribune or the new york times or something like that
pretty low
right i i really like n p r a lot
right yeah i miss n p r a lot also i really like them because they give uh instead of being as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good
and they also their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing
right yeah
sure was
yeah that was but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the clarence thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was r- really good
well but the
but the ne- news news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about c span which i i tune into every once in a while
yeah it it is really kind of boring but you know that's if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it and that's what you're supposed you're supposed to if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it
as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
let's see mine's pretty easy actually uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new saturns
uh and although i can't afford it right now i would just like love to have one
no regardless of that fact it's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing
and uh it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away
handling power everything yeah it just got like the top rating it was compared up against uh let's see there was like the mazda m x three uh nissan's whatever their two n x two thousand the civic s i and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
mustang g t -s uh can't afford it
right yeah i'm a graduate student and let's face it i don't make any money so
yeah we'll see then yeah right now i'm stuck i i've got a a pontiac sunbird turbo that it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- saturn
oh yeah i'd do it i'd use it for both the nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both
uh just like a uh set up a lot of times and it's like really large uh parking lots
and pylons
and things
tight turns hard acceleration i've seen a lot of mustangs uh compete and it's interesting they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class
uh what are you thinking about buying
the legend
yeah well i was i was actually in uh a lot of the b m w -s are produced in uh sh- uh stutgardt and uh and munich
and i was i was there this uh summer and uh i- i was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and
such for b m w
oh of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed
yeah the uh the b m w is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and and then you go to porsche and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade
and no two of them are alike
so it's like completely opposed i don't know which do i like better i think i like the porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical
unless it's it's a toy
let's face it
yeah yeah but it it b m w -s good for that what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
wow yeah
that's cool
yeah that's good i also i was impressed by uh by the mercedes too
i really i really like the mercedes
the factory was nice and
and is it different for the for the b m w
right i can
imagine that
oh really you like uh so you're an american
you want to buy american
it terms of handling uh acceleration
what about mustang g t -s
those so you're talking about ones in a lower lower end p- price range
well you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money you can buy whatever you want
right would you use that for city driving and racing
autocrossing is what kind of track is that
okay and you put up set up the
track pylons
oh really
yeah i would guess so
uh i think i'd like to get uh b m w or if i go the german route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a hon- i mean a a acura legend
a lexus uh s c three hundred maybe
something on that order i haven't really determined if i like the the japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one * looks like a complete slash unit to me
you know because your b m w -s your german cars have good reputations i think
yeah they their they have the whole philosophy i mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better
which is kind of hard to take
i mean
as you're walking through that little tour in uh munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too
oh really
yeah that's
no it's not realistic
yeah if you can
afford that kind of a toy then i guess uh
yeah just work short trips no m- no heavy mileage i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year
so it's pretty minimal
lasts a long time that's mainly what i'm looking for
oh yeah
but if if you have a problem with a mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
uh i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different once you get up
in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly
i'm kind yeah i'm not sure if i really want
all right
okay how many kids do you have
yeah we we've been married for two and a half years we've been trying for about two years but
no luck yet hopefully
she had another call she has just three kids eleven nine and eight
all right
that keeps you bu-
do you have a lot of activities with your kids
uh-huh so they're pretty good kids huh
well we had ni- wh- growing up i guess i can talk about us we had nine kids in our family we had eight boys and one girl but my dad uh
yeah and the time that my we spent with our dad was he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time so that's how we spent most of the time with him
that was a dead giveaway huh
which that
i was going to say my sister wasn't spoiled very much
yeah that's but
yeah it's like you said you know to each his own and we're planning on having my wife stay home and but
well that's good sounds like you're have a handle on it
um no not right now
right well we just moved down here we used to live up in seattle for a couple of years
it's that's no problem here yeah we really liked it up there but then wh-
i think w- i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children we
have three children who are eleven nine and eight so this is the big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but
perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time and
anyway you don't have children
but you're married
you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute
i'll be right back excuse me
just a moment they're going to get mad
i'm so sorry
that was my daughter's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow
brownie meeting
well i don't want to i don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but yes we do
both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade and the school years are wonderful they're just wonderful
the kids they are real people and they are interesting and
they they have all their own activities and um i think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel
i'm su- sure that's coming though but
they are wonderful kids
you had eight boys and one girl
are you mormons
that's what the utah and the large family
well we're catholics i came from a family of five i had four brothers
the only girl
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
i never felt spoiled
in fact i always thought my toys were destroyed
no usually busy fighting for survival
well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um
that i think um i don't know it's an interesting problem i happen to um i'm a pediatrician
my husband is a physician so uh i i i talk to parents about this a lot but children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt
that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family
and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home
i really believe that and it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure
and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's i really think it's true for our family
and i think it has worked very well
there's no question i think that's really the best if if a woman is happy doing that
i hate to put it quite that way
i was twenty-nine when i had my first child and uh i would not have been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child
it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but uh i like th- i like the way i did it
i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours i nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year and i
you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers
um and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in
some baby-sitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they they learn to share they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure
i think that helps
well so so
so your wife does she work right now
she's out
you're still trying to dry out
i don't believe that we're
the recycling program here is just terrible i mean it's hard to find places to go i mean kroger does a couple things they i don't think they do they do newspapers
the one in florida is so cool because they pick up everything they pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff
they pick up everything
i know it i know it
it piles up
i just don't know
i just don't know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff
i know it i know it
oh yeah
well i mean it's real you ought to because the the the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything
and since we go there all the time i mean
probably at all
oh by the way may name's julie
i'm from atlanta
i just think that everybody ought to do it
the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs
oh yeah they have uh uh what i what i used to uh now that i don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time
and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
a- but also most places like big star does and i'm not sure if kroger does or not but
yeah and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in
can bring them in
i know it i know it
it really is a small
hostile planet
did you know that
no really not did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper
filled with paper
well it is it is though
it is because they
well they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper you know
takes something like twenty times as long to decompose
you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper it will still be there in a couple of weeks
it will be whole you'll be able to read
off of it
yeah um
well white paper's bad too they they treat it too
i'm sure that's fine
i'm sure
maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again
you think
i don't know well i mean
i think we've kind of you know i mean everybody everybody
everybody has a computer
we would no longer need
paper at all
i would love that
so what do you think about uh recycling programs in atlanta julie
i don't know there's there's big bins out there i don't know if they ever get i i really don't know what the details are there should be someplace where you could call and find out as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you but i think there should be some kind of curbside service
that's the only way i could really
during the summers like the around where i live the uh homeless people see- i mean they all have like shopping carts and
stuff and they're go around and collect cans
and aluminum and stuff and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them
but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something
so i don't do that anymore and the the recycling at georgia tech like that uh outside the uh student center
they never empty those things
they just overflow
so what's a guy to do
you know * shouldn't this end in a slash
i asked myself
really huh oh yeah that's true hadn't thought about that that is very inconvenient
inconvenient even
but uh so you do recycle don't you
yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of bad about it
if i if see a s- if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something
i'll throw it in there but i don't really i don't ever take anything
but wait
i've never seen you before
who are you
yeah my name's bill well
me too
uh well is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy julie
do they do like what about like uh what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know
what about like those grocery bags
they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic
those petroleum products are going to kill us
the hostile planet i think
the petroleum pretty much i mean those petroleum products i think are the big uh you know
the great satan of the recycling
paper just seems so innocuous
paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know
it comes from trees how can it be bad
they treat it with chemicals or something why can't trees break down i don't get it
i'm going to switch
from those yellow legal pads then
i'm glad you told me that because i use those at work where i work and uh
but i can just
forget that from now on i'm going u- i'm going to switch to the white ones
well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam- you know bamboo stuff from the
from the
banks of the nile
you think so
i think we should just abandon the you know the written word
altogether you know
what do you think
kind of radical i know but
that's true
everyone had a two way wrist watch t v -s on their wrist
like uh dick tracy
okay eric uh are you married and do you have a family
okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
i see uh
well that's basically what we do uh about every every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks i work part time at night
and he works and my husband works full times days and so we have four checks but that works out nice because we get paid every week and
so that does help
that helps a lot and then uh we don't have a lot ex- extra for extra spending
so it's pretty well ear marked
yeah every penny is ear marked but uh it we have found that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half but and divide those up between all uh-huh
and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
that's true
well it helps you to focus where your money goes
and and i am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget but you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money
go where does it go
and also we have found that if we write down and we did this we are not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought when you know every pay check
and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's we should cause it does help
wel- just stick to that uh-huh that is
yeah that
that sounds like a really good idea
and it really helpful uh have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet
oh uh-huh
oh that's good that's a good feeling
my husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago
so finally
finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or
uh yes i am to uh both questions
uh yeah we do we uh uh basically there's the you know the expenses that are fixed during the month
you know the ones that come every every month and we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet and uh whatever is left uh after that we
you know we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to
generally going to shoot for
so what do you do
yeah all allocated out
all the checks yeah
right yeah we found that uh
it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses
we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were uh spending uh money for things that you know we kind of tended to eat out a bit more
than we should have
and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh thought it to be really helpful we have gotten some of our loans paid off really
because of this and stuff like that so
that's a lot of money but
yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that helps is you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit
it's just to uh uh get up the money in advance and put it in uh uh so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses
or whatever just put it in uh
in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount * should end with a slash this is an independent clause as is b's next turn
and then once that was gone well * should be start of a new slash unit--see b.58 utt2
if the entertainment amount was gone
for the month say oh it's gone
we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire debt uh completely retire debt for car payments and
credit card
uh credit card debt and all of that we are just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so
yeah well i
a student
yeah i am actually in the in the mas-
i guess we're talking about exercise huh
oh i am twenty-seven
you do what type of exercise do you do
oh you do
are they different from aerobics or is it the same thing
and you do that every day or
oh okay
and this is a club or uh do you belong to a group
do you go with friends or do you go alone
oh yeah young mothers or
uh i really don't have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and
that's what i do every day
yeah pretty much when my wife lets me
no i just shoot around by myself
and uh that's about it i use to play soccer a lot in high school but when i graduated i haven't done much i don't have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i don't have a problem with weight i could eat all day and not gain an ounce
you do exercise
you do it
yeah and i
well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but i don't know
yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so that's why i've kept active in that way
uh basketball volleyball uh too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby i do that
uh i use to but it got too expensive so
yeah a lot of people do that
and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things
oh they come up here
that's in nevada
oh yeah but
there's snow bird or alta
huh i've never heard of that one
do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but
oh yeah is one or two timer a year if i do go on them and i am really sore after
my legs really really ache
but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before
yeah yeah well first of all i i ha- have to ask you how how old you are
twenty-seven okay well i am quite a bit older than you are
but no i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis
well i do uh jazzercise
which is an aerobic uh program that are you familiar with it
it's uh you know a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in plano that has classes like all day long so you can
no it's really it's an aerobic routine yo- you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
no i only do it probably two or three times a week
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week
well it's really a i mean it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time and then you just go in whenever you can so like i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
no i go by myself and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me
and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise or they might play tennis
and since i am not a tennis player uh you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties
so uh there aren't many people you know that want to do that
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers you know with with children between the ages
young mothers you know young women
with small children
are the ones that i find well what do you do
oh great
yeah do you play every day
well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just
well see that's that's th- really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising
i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise
you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise
but i also watch what i eat
you know but you'll come being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet
but as you get older you will
well it might not
mine because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself
and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high
yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball
but do you ski being in utah i was wondering if you ski
oh did it really
cause i know that skiing in utah is is suppose to be great
yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to utah all the time and they think it's really
and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski well is it tahoe where you ski from no that's nevada to california
i guess
yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
but there's a fun- there is a place in utah called a funny name
but it's like oh heavenly is that it
yeah i think it's called heavenly
you've never heard of that
well maybe it isn't in utah
but they said they've skied heavenly and it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it's kind of funny
oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
and then is it your quadriceps that are the worst
in your legs and
yeah yeah
well and it's strange that you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over
okay so frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have
right that's uh sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have
i am single so
i guess i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
right i don't need to i am the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
uh and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well
and uh i try to try to have an idea of what my expenses are and i am pretty consistent from month to month
and uh whenever uh i need to uh whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
yeah that's i guess i kind of do a similar thing more uh medium or longer range i just have a maybe a targeted amount that i will save for like i am probably within a year i would like to buy a new car
so i kind of have a an amount in my mind and i am making every effort to to sal- put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever
have you thought about uh leasing
i see
but if you are rolling it over every three years
it might be advantageous to do that
you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off
of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
that's right yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had a number of expenses
but uh i am hoping that most of them were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year
i hope that i only have a slow period before i do that again
right what line of work are you in
well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way budget our money apparently the uh my wife uh has so much uh gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every month
really don't need to
that's right
right well i found that uh you know things as i have gotten older i am in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that kind of anticipate how much things were going to be uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so
i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but what i do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i will just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
and i guess that's a way of budgeting
uh-huh yeah uh cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too
uh you know we've got two cars my wife has a car and i like to drive pick up truck so we are on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know i am constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments
so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually i am saving up for another one besides so
it's you know it's kind of a never ending thing but
you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh you only you're not paying for two of at the same time
i guess is what i am saying
well uh i have thought about it but leasing wouldn't you know i don't use it for my business
my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work
which is only ten miles away so
yeah i guess uh
right yeah you're right uh i have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff in them you know
those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say
so that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month
how do you feel about the viet nam war
yeah i saw that as well
uh-huh well were
you ever in viet nam or
um i was much too young i was born in sixty-seven so
um you know both my well both my brothers were um draft age but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for
well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there
um do you think i mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it
i totally agree with that um
what what effects do you think it's had on our country
uh-huh i think you know that's pretty typical that of the entire entire involvement over that you know that nothing was really addressed it was- it wasn't you know it was never we we announced that we were going to war it was such a gradual and subtle you know
thi- um you know increasement of of force that
i vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something
uh-huh um so um do do do you think that like uh um for example like in in this past war in the persian gulf war
that uh that you see it seemed to me that that bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war
uh i wasn't really keeping count but i guess good-bye
huh well um you know i guess it's pretty deep feelings uh i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it good morning viet nam
and uh
got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings i really appreciated the the whole uh english class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do it you know the guy's gouging gouging your eyes out what are you going to do
you know what for him to finish me off
and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of asian philosophy
that uh
no no i was kind of an in-between uh finally drew a high draft number and you
well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo i had a passport and was ready to go
or um out of the country or
join special forces either one
i mean i just didn't know so uh
um yeah just a second
okay sure now well mark um what was that again
no not not really
downside um uh well the says we should uh go into the grief that that's there and you know presidents have always avoided that
as a country so it's pretty serious really you know lot of things that aren't being addressed
gulf of tonkin uh resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo you remember that
yeah yeah only only it was foggy and finally president johnson said well they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo
isn't that something
hey mark
i've got to go um
we'll see you i guess our five minutes are up according to me are they to you
yeah okay bye-bye
okay so uh mike what are your opinions on uh trial by jury
uh-huh yeah that that seems to make sense but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different
right th- they ha-
how do you feel about setting like well for example a car type accident where uh or some incident where someone loses a limb do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts
that's true
oh out of thei- r-
as opposed to the corporat- insurance paying the bills
uh-huh well we're
who who do they get they get insured they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work
oh okay your talking about corpor-
but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings
for oh th-
right that will
well i work for an insurance company so i see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided um by juries particularly and i know in england the judges set all of the awards you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence but then they leave the awards up to more learned people and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars
oh exactly each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range
when you get one way out like that but then really doesn't pen- wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us
if they get some of those mega awards against them you know they're not going to sit there and lose money if they are losing money then they're going to raise rates
so it all comes filtering down to us all in- individually
and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged
you know
i don't know you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s- pre specified in the policy so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody's limb
uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases i think maybe you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old
i i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there and there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing
and that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges
i don't know
you know to get into the economics of things uh because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards
it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away
if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages
i think those should be uninsurable i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that
that did the damage
for for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens one of their employees causes damage or something
sure that's what they buy insurance for
well i was just talking about any company uh
let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and
uh somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures
sure insurance should pay for that
well i'm not talking about any loss i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l- usually a lot less but it's an an amount they're designed to sting them a little for their
for gross wanton negligence in a claim
and unfortunately the ch- the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too
so again it never really penalizes
the company doing the wrong they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to
and if if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware
of that
then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
so how's your products been
i hear that one have you had any lately go out
oh wow
so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out
you're kidding
yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
yeah the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so
i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong but
that's incredible
and they all went out at the same time
or two days wow
wow it's frustrating
uh-huh they go out a lot
yeah see i'm in the manufacturing home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
at morton international and i thin- well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything after each assembly process and so our testing is pretty thorough but
um the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't i think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags
and but we do test after during the assembly project product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so
well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government it's incredible how much testing they have to do
um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out
yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three and they unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
yeah it was a hassle
yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the i- the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself passed its three years and it was three years and two months
uh watch out
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the
the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce
and they uh the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
uh within two days of each other
i was it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
and plus the place that i'd bought them all had gone out of business so even if i i think even if i had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that retailer so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not
but i didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty
so it was a call to the local appliance dealer
who came out and fixed them all but i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with uh i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and the other two weren't but i just other than that you know t v -s and things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
oh really
that's interesting
do you do you test each individual one
or do you just test like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about but that
oh i'm sure they want to be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh
well jackie uh on taxes i i guess i would have to say that i that my opinion is that i do think americans are paying too much in taxes uh what's your feeling about that
right uh where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
uh uh-huh in new hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax
uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent and we have what we call the five b s uh th- for our taxes booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax
bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that americans generally do pay too much in taxes and
well that's nice
nice nice to get a refund
uh-huh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we are getting value for it
yeah uh my my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state and they say they are going to send some back it's like giving yourself a tra- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
you know what i mean
uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because
right because uh there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you
that it
well it does it it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend uh it's almost like they will spend as much as the they're allowed to collect you know
uh there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you would have a certain amount i mean you would take you total salary
those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes and then there would be a set amount for however many people you know dependent you have and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you know after you figure up who's in your family
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with
i i'd like to see something like that i think it would be fairer and it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys our of business and i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans
i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
it doesn't seem fair to me
i think your taxes in wisconsin are pretty high i i if i am not mistaken aren't they i
mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is
twenty percent
just you just pay it huh
you're like you're like my daughter who is in college down in massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she is attending college full time also
and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them up she really has no idea she gets a refund check and
i agree i think taxes are high
oh yes uh-huh
right yeah i i agree and i think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting well if you do get money back from like jobs i'm still a student
so uh i only work part time so i i get a check back so
from from taxes but
yeah it is but it's not much so
yeah there you go
right yeah
i don't know i don't seem like they are doing much with it i mean there's plans there and now that they are voting and people you know getting into drug and that stuff
they have nice plans and uh but they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work you know but taxes get raise so i don't know i'm not really into politics uh
i don't really understand it
but it's just you know
right huh
yeah the could be nice
right yeah
right huh
yeah it isn't there is not much out there that is fair that's for sure
huh i will agree to that
um no
i i have no idea i just my dad does it all for me
i use
okay how do you keep up with current events
yeah what what channel do you watch or what station
that's the one i watch i usually keep up with t v i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
too great sometimes
yeah the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music
yeah do you think that t v is uh pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or
yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics
just not like basic news
going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for
you know actual news i think you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
they typically have a better i am from a small town too here in texas
and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and
yeah farm report and oil reports
that's pretty pretty sad or who killed who
yeah well in uh in dallas i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's and the story was uh
yeah and the news covered it
right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who
had everything and then like three days later this uh local news station was using as as their promo
to promote themselves i just thought that was really that's kind of cold
yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people
and they were showing people crying
i mean just taking advantage of you know
yeah it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions it's just gotten so i mean somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite that if you know
and everything
what did you think of the coverage of the war
did you
they kept just showing you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually
the damage that really happened that's
a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties
and they kind of you know if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who
you know got really hurt and everything
um well actually usually uh in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work uh usually catch the news in the morning
uh n b c
yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know t v uh again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like you know like what today's stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one
yeah i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
well what i really don't like about t v especially local news as compared to like national news is just uh it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed and you know it's it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom
or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is your kid's bus driver smoking crack
on the way to school you know
yeah also also i have the observation of uh with the press is that like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life
you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
it's something wrong
yeah the farm report
uh-huh also i have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and
was that like he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something
oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know uh channel x gives you the best coverage you know we were on the scene with our team players and
they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for
yeah yeah you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
uh you know even the national news i just find it to be you know
very watered down very
uh i fou- i found it very one sided
uh you know it it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
uh you know not saying that we shou- that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know
yeah and i really think that you know in the involvement that the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
think about uh taxes
you spend what you have and
yeah i think that the general idea is to s- you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but they're running under the assump- you know the way they're running it now they're h- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running so that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe but so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay f- you know get what you pay for
yeah there's
i agree with that
i guess i'm i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored i go to a state sponsored school and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose because i don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long my parents i guess h- h- however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back i will this year anyway from a
yeah i am
i need it too otherwise
more taxes you pay
uh-huh isn't
well isn't
uh-huh there's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes
the taxes that people don't think about that yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess
uh-huh there was that
which can- was it jerry brown one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a f- i think a flat percentage something like that
exactly that's because
until like eight
up until like eighty-five or something was the
well i think they're a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh
you you don't spend more than you than you bring in
well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living
so i think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants
uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society
but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
uh you're very fortunate
we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount uh
we don't regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one
uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and
everything else and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax
now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there
even though there's uh taxes on different things
but you know there's f- there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax
you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your
but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes
yeah if you impl- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder
and make any more or create any more jobs
and so
based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer
okay you want to start
uh-huh yeah that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago
have they stopped that practice now
oh yeah
yeah yeah
um yeah yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that's putting out a lot of dark
smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of
cars but that that particular bothers me
oh i see
yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons and that uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know inexpensive and lots of it uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
well course there's a a tremendous number of refrigerators and fre- excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the new cars i guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems but uh there's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
and that's got me very you know highly concerned that uh that's going to be quite a while before we can uh
undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help
pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion so so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting uh compound
because as i say there's a there's a tremen- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator and then do you know that number and then how many a a freezer separate from
and how many people especially here in texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree
and i mean
so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towar- towards uh uh and that's a pollut- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with with water and uh really make uh make a mess
well most most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the busses with the diesel
that's uh those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor uh because when you when diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely that you don't have any uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh is not very volatile
you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily and it's got well you know its latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one
and so if the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
well how do you feel about trial by jury
in what way
oh do do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
so do you think that i mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries
where they feel sorry
uh-huh the other thing the only thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be i i like the idea of juries of your peers
uh in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
uh-huh i'd
agree with that that's definitely a problem
yeah yeah i guess i i definitely agree with you but sin- the well what i don't like about uh sentence the jury doing the sentencing
in that i think it becomes a lot less the the same crime gets unequal sentences
i uh i think there is more of an ability of you know you know for selecting a jury two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea uh the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty
or innocent
but i think i think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board
of course a lot of that's also the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer
yeah i agree
oh yeah i i agree with it yeah they will admit to you that they can- don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty
it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument
that the
yeah uh this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented i have uh very little regard for the law
presently practiced
i was thinking primarily criminal cases
uh-huh that's a concern of mine uh i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
yeah my question i guess are they really your peers
uh too often i think they are not
and uh when you when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have
you know that is a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
uh now i happen to know several judges and there is one that i would feel uncomfortable but has me- doing sentencing without the jury
i would feel a little bit uneasy about
but the other two i feel uh would give either you know the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law
and i guess that's what i am concerned with
this is very true
yeah and you do see such uneven sentencing
you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean
where uh it would appear the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty-five years and the other one was sentenced to life so
isn't that the truth
there are times when is it uh oh goodness my mind has gone blank it's uh othello you know where he says kill all the lawyers
every now and then one is tempted to see what what
but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice
as we think of you know as as
novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
they are very effective too
uh even i have been involved uh just sli- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty
but uh his attorneys gotten him off
uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge so i don't know
okay so you have eight children um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together
uh-huh yeah we know how that goes uh with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation
well that's fun so um let's see uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and you may think this is funny but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark
in our house and that is so fun the kids just get a crack out of that um we like we do like to go to the park too you uh like your family um we don't do a lot of vacationing have you taken a lot of vacations together or
uh-huh and whe-
oh now where do they live
oh so that's a bit of a drive for you there
oh so you like to go there for the holidays and
oh uh-huh uh what are the ages of your kids then
oh yeah so you have some in the nest and some out huh
we have ours start at twelve and then they go down to four
i bet yeah
yes uh-huh
yes and then if you want to play something on the little kids level then the older kids get real bored and they want to do something else so
yeah i can i can relate to that um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one
that's good
oh good
i think so and i feel like you know like president bush bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home
and so i i'm a firm believer in that too
yes that's that's true well we see that a lot out here in utah and um hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh
oh um do you have a lot of large families out there in texas or
very few you feel like you're in the minority
oh dear
well out here in utah five is about the
the average yeah
oh oh i have some relatives out there in texas in fact my mom's out there in texas right now in dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch and
well uh no i'm trying aberdeen
is is that close to dallas
don't you
it's i guess it's out there clear out they have a ranch that has like five hundred acres and
oh we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling uh going to the park um some time watching v c r
um generally cheap things
that's right
most of our vacations are to go and see grandma and grandpa
we get an occasional one or two day thing
but most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa
in arizona
oh we don't go very often for holidays generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays
and let grandma and grandpa come and visit us
they range from twenty-four to five
that's right
how old are your children
i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together
with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing
but the young kids don't understand it
and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and
i think it's improving actually
we had an interesting experience the other day we we have pretty much a a routine that we spend we don't have our kids play with other kids on sunday
and we just kind of keep them at home
and our next door neighbor uh we were at a soccer game saturday and our next door neighbor was there and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend saturday night at their house
and she said no sunday's our family day
and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now
i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction
and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something so
utah's a lot better than texas
very few
oh definitely
when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense
but uh
my wife and i were in utah until
i guess we were about twenty-four
never been back since then but
we have kids up there now so we get up occasionally
where where in dallas
i don't have any idea i've never
heard of it must be a
little town
okay martin do you do any exercise
uh-huh um so those are more or less indoor sports how's the
weather out there in georgia
well yeah i'm on a exercise program i'm riding my aerodyne bike um
half an hour every morning and i'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time it's
it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
no huh-uh i first of all i'd like to get my weight off i'm about fifty pounds overweight and so i'd like to get the weight off and then i'd really like to get into that
and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called the firm i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but you're using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it's
it's really fun
yes uh-huh
um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that
that's the big thing huh
so how is that
now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees
oh dear
oh that's good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he
he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy
so that's what he does he wears his his brace and his high tops and
oh dear oh
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches
and i would once i start my forty- i'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day
but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds
real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty-five pound dumbbells
and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video so
it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to losing this weight and
being firm and healthy
yes now this one has been quite mild um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground it was quite chilly but not
yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do
um in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the
summer time or in the spring fall but in the winter it gets pretty cold
um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
um how about yourself
right do you do uh any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
yes it's it's it's aero- it's similar to aerobics with weights
but it's like low impact aerobics just
with weights
okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics
uh yes i have in in atlanta that's um most of the health clubs
are all that's the that's the in thing
at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have
kind of taken over
um it they call it a low impact aerobics and it's supposed to burn off more calories
at the same time and from when i've done it it does give you a good a real good workout
but only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees
you know that and movement of going up on the step
you know that could create a problem
they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know
yeah i i think my ankles probably are my main weak point
but i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an- a support ankle brace which is very stiff
and um we- wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so
yeah i
uh-huh yeah i did i injured mine so many times that
rehabilitating became quite easy
i mean it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it
because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself
to play that way
but um so how how successful is your exercise video
so it's a good workout
so in the winter i guess there's a lot of it's quite cold and
i pressed the button one so we're recording right now i'm sorry
okay and i'm melanie from harrisville utah
yeah um okay bill we're talking about family reunions
okay um have you ever had to plan a family reunion
uh-huh and how did you feel it went
all this planning and and getting together and such um oh let's see what else
oh boy
oh my word well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together
oh that's good
uh-huh and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring it was just pot luck
yeah yeah show off a little bit
oh now how old is she
oh goodness is she pretty spry is she you know pretty
oh wow
oh oh that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age yeah
really well that sounds fun well i i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago and there were we sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there and so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and i wasn't very at that duty for two years in a row but i found that advance planning was the key to success
oh that's wonderful though
oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness well australia i have a brother lives in australia to uh boise idaho and and uh all kinds of places
we are
oh my gosh
they must really like it there
yeah oh
oh you're ready to move on to bi-
that's okay i'm bill from raleigh
oh another one from a different state besides texas
uh yes and no it wasn't really a fa- a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday
and i brought a lot of family together then
it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i i kind of know how to do these things
i used to you know
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and
and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think
they show up and all their kids and then all she has uh i have like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and
they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe
um the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that um for the rent we rented like a a rescue squad building or something
like that
and uh each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks and
and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill
and each person in the family you know brought a dish or something
it was kind of pot luck
you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
yeah and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first
because she's such a great cook
uh she's eighty-six
now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better
than me as a matter of fact
oh yeah my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her
uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever
but most of all my family lives like in the same county so
but it's just kind of like get on the telephone and
it's so and such days from such and such date
and everybody just shows up
i would say you're spread out then
uh my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because my dad was in the army and we're
we're pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to carolinas we still are the only ones do not live in
in yantsen county
i live in raleigh and then my my parents live in greenville and i have one brother and his wife
live in greenville and uh another brother that lives in outside of fayetteville so i mean we're we're spread out but
everybody else is centralized in in my home town waynesboro so
nobody moves away except us
yeah i got out as soon as i graduated
just like this town is too small for me good-bye
how do you feel about gun control
well don't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry i mean
it varies from state to state
there is no national
uh in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon
you know or on probation or uh you know other obvious things like that uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun
uh yeah i'd probably i'd probably say about a five
seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know
well you know uh uh no- if you are looking at like you know country that uh where they do have a lot more gun control like england and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much
well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states
uh you know i mean the problem though you know they if the since the united states had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already
you know so it's it's really kind of a complex problem
uh i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up
uh i mean i think you know in the te- i mean i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
no i've thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something i probably wouldn't get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun just for protecting myself you know from
burglar type thing i do kind of live in the downtown area
you know and shotguns are really good because they're i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
uh and you know you yeah i just don't understand these people you know like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know they are probably going to miss the person and and they're going to shoot through five wall
and hit someone you know i mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of
you know whoever
you pretty much stop them and you don't then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
yeah that that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person
that that person rushes you
and you know you're pretty much dead you know
because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then
you know and and well i mean you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you are a real danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you
yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something
well uh i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed
but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns
and then like with the stuff of that massacre in killeen texas not too long ago
but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh prevent that
yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now
but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
huh i didn't know that well that's pretty scary so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
that's where i would probably be
well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better
because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff
and i can understand them wanting to have them but then again it's just like all those nuts out there
it has because then
well is the crime that bad there in atlanta
yeah i know dallas is
i don't know if dallas is in the top three
but do you own a gun
that's true
well now when i first moved to dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because
you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it
and if i am not going to you know
be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it
and they get it from you
set them off
yeah well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well
you know i don't want it if i don't know how to oper- you know if i don't really know how to use it
and i just didn't want the responsibility
so well uh did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever
yeah right that kind of
i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns i would be scared selling guns to people
so julie how do you feel about aids research
i'd agree too but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know uh you know it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research than a l- l- longer ago
you know because you know because uh the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients
i think they cover aids but what they do is uh if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy
they'll uh check to see if you're h i v positive and if you are not only will they not give you uh a policy but they'll uh they have like there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again
i think a lot of it was was just that you know becau- because of of the audi- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were people
no one really cared about
uh-huh yeah uh yeah one one one h- one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know aids was you know god's punishment
was that then lesbians must be god's chosen people
but uh
so uh
uh do you think d- you mean do you actually think we're doing enough right now to
private organizations
i mean it seems that you know it's just you know of it's just going to reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud to q- quote barney fife
uh-huh i would probably agree with that
uh so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of uh people
i think it's i think it stands a really interesting question of uh
i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
oh yeah yeah for certain
exactly does does like d- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover diseases like that
um well that's but that's why they should have s- started doing stuff before i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out
who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know
right and all these god-fearing people were like well you know
god is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera
boy that's a good one
no i really don't i did i did like a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff and uh really we're not doing much at all i mean most of what gets raised i mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by uh uh you know
conscious yeah communities and things like that you know
like uh san francisco has a a real uh strong aids support group and all that kind of stuff and
and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real
and from corporations around the around the city you know for aids research and that kind of thing and uh i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's
bound to spread
right yeah i don't know i don't know i i i don't know what the likelihood of that is but i mean you know people really waking up
especially with the ultra conservatives
move our our political system s- sort of seems to be taking
yeah so
god that's a good question fish i don't know uh i think i think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would
you know
and it's really it's really not necessary uh until until the disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious
and uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that
they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely cut off from from the community
and that and uh i don't know i guess i think that that uh research is i guess the most important just because i you know it it really needs to come to an end
you know i don't know i don't know fish what do you think about that subject
well what do you feel about the um present situation in the mideast
yeah i agree i think i think there's definitely been some changes um and i think you know the the um end of the soviet union will definitely have its effect on on the situation
um you know in that there's there's not you kno- there you know i- you know basically since the end of world war two there was always you know that little proxy war going on
you know with um the u s funding israel and and the um soviet union funding the arab countries
uh-huh yeah but on the same token you know israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the u s in being you know the foothold of capitalism
you know in in the mideast
uh-huh yeah but on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
they basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies
the u s would claim that they would have not given them to them
i mean of course you know public statements can be taken for
uh-huh you know well to begin with you know i pretty much question or what what the u s -s motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement
uh i the cynical side of me says that you know it was more for uh the the domestic political situation than for anything else
you know and that you know and for portraying bush is a strong president
uh i mean i really i really think that that my gut feeling is that that you know he pretty much picked picked the fight with uh with um hussein
i mean i'm not not saying at all that hussein wasn't quite willing to ge- enter that fight
but you know i think i think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt
where a lot w-
i think i mean i thought i think that um in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
and i i really don't i really don't think that i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests
yeah and i mean in in in along this line since since you know it it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh the iraqis out of kuwait
i just don't i just don't i i i d- i i i don't foresee bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle
um you know over over the uh over over what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically
well i have i have very fixed feelings about israel um i think that that for a long while we've we've had almost a you know ha- t-
well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is
what do you think mark
oh yeah
and then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much
or supplied with arms the same way
well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of israel ourselves
you know we s- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet
overall tend to support them but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war
uh in uh kuwait was uh the fact that they did not retaliate
for the uh scud missiles that were uh launched there that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the u s
i see
oh you don't think they got the codes from the u s already
i see
that's true they can yet they
well what do y- what about this situation with the you know the uh continual uh harassment by iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the uh arms inspectors have free access
huh yeah okay
well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh
you know move on into kuwait and see what happens
yeah well may have been you know i'm not saying that that's not the case uh
no it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there
even at this point
yeah well what about uh do you have any any views on uh israel's relation to the u s do you
think we ought to you know
back off on our support of the country or what do yo-
do you have a p c
uh-huh yeah a lot of my friends are into macintoshes i have a um p c a i b m p c myself
a two eighty-six i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six um
um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal
um but i um i think eventually i'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty-six before i move up to windows
although you know i do like the the graphical user environment
yeah it's um i want i want to be able i just want it more for multi tasking which i suppose is also like a macintosh
yeah that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an apple two e in my high school
well do you use your computer for um just things around the house or in the
well see what do you do
oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um are are they based on on a on a um other language or are they based are they based like a lot of the um you know a lot of the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world and the teacher just tries to tries to teach english you know through natural understanding
well it was just uh when i was high school i worked for the community school and they had a english second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke english not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
i imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that
uh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
yeah i would imagine so um so um what were you doing when you were using an apple two e
uh-huh it it's
yes it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a t r s eighty with four k on it
and you know then then we then i started playing with apples you know and those had forty-eight or you know if they were really great
they had sixty-four k
uh i know
i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k on them is all and
there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty-eight k and there was only one computer that had forty-eight k on it at the time
and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure about macintoshes but i know i b m -s you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
you know that's that's your low- that's the low end uh
uh-huh yeah i imagine
yes i have a macintosh s e thirty
what do you use yours for mostly
well i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get into uh a little bit more communications now i've just today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to
send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way
uh are you using windows
uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a macintosh
well the one thing i used to use a uh i've never used an i b m actually i used to use a just an apple two e which of course is
looks pretty primitive now
but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh mac right now
i don't have uh any compilers
so i'm uh
i use it in my business
i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh english as a second language programs
that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly
you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that
right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that
are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive
and i use it for t- uh data analysis on testing so
well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
you know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't
find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use
well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly
and with smaller files i can't believe you know i've got uh five uh megabytes on this one now
and on my two e i had a hundred twenty-eight k
oh the old
the old apple uh the the original apple had what yeah forty-eight i guess didn't it
my goodness
well the s p thirty goes up to eight
but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
okay bill right
okay bill have you done much camping
oh well that that sounds good
yeah you do um now do you have a lot mountains well you don't have mountains in texas do you where do you find places to camp
oh my word well that sounds adventuresome
well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i um we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven and so they're involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them
um yes they've well no actually they've i remember they have taken the the du- the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire and i don't think they've taken the stoves um last year they camped in tents and this year i believe they will be in tents also
uh-huh yeah
oh is that right
oh and what does that consist of
yes well see when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents and i like to sleep on the air matresses i'm not my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the matresses
um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that
my word
uh they're covered like with a heavy armor
type stuff uh-huh
my word
but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
oh my word
well that sounds a little less fierce than bears we we want to
uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in boy scouts
and i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year
i'd say i camp quite a bit
well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us
and so we canoe down the river and then
sleep on the river on one of the um sand bars and then
get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
how about yourself
well that's good
what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves
uh-huh course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah
it doesn't get very cold in texas
so lots of times we don't even take tents
we just use trail tarps
uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it
and make it into a tent
uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see
so you carry them with you and
they'll keep you dry or whatever
ye- yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
uh in the morning and the afternoon
just deer everywhere
uh-huh so uh but it even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with boy scouts so
of course we don't uh want to go hunting
but we got to see a lot of deer
um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what
armadillo is
and possums and uh raccoons
and we have those creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
they will if you attack them
but most time they run away from you
if they if they see you're up you know
but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep
music do you like
i am more into rock and roll myself
do you like any bluegrass
well at least your
not really
uh we'll have to uh
i have a lot of friends that like country music
no i'm more into uh older rock like the psychedelic era like uh
se- late sixties seventies uh
greatful dead crosby stills and nash
oh i've heard a little bit of it i've just
uh now i've heard of striper so the only one i can
uh the first of amy grant before
was you know became more mainstream top forty
i've never actually seen her in concert i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show
uh-huh uh
i like some country music it's just that i like finding a lot of it's
mama got run over by the train
like garth brooks
reba macintyre
you don't like patsy cline
you don't like patsy cline
uh yeah actually i just went to see the greatful dead about i guess about a week ago
no they're they are still on tour they have been touring
since the late sixties
they're still together they're still
making albums
in fact i mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around from city to city
on tour selling tie dye and things like that
yeah they're they're like late forties early fifties but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players they keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new one's in this thirties you know uh
but uh
yeah well they don't actually look as rough as the rolling stones they just i don't know if you saw the tour posters of the rolling stones when they last toured but it looked like leather day at the geriatric
all their faces were just all shriveled
i mean it just just looked like they
got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
well uh
actually i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just uh just so that you know that if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into lala land
so uh have you seen any concerts lately
uh lots of different kinds i guess uh i like country music of course
texas and i listen to christian music a lot because there's a christian music station here in in our city so i listen to it quite a bit
uh-huh and i listen cause on friday nights they have the uh they have what they call saturday night alive or they have on saturday night friday night and saturday night
and they have christian rock and roll so
you know they have that type of music but they just have different words
so i listen to that too
uh no not really huh-uh
and i like
i like rap music do you like rap music
not really
well i can tell we're we're together here
okay uh
what kind of
what kind of rock music do you listen to do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff or
seventies and like that stuff
yeah i have friends that like that
so you have never heard of like the christian music that i listen to probably
like have you heard of uh of carmen have you ever heard of kim
striper they're the really heavy yeah
like the heavy metal stuff
i guess
yeah cause she she plays both secular and christian so
yeah i like her too
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers
she does
she's real good she's real good so i like her
i don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog
left me everybody's left me
yeah i don't like that
you know i like randy travis
you know i like more of the real new ones you know
garth brooks oh yes you know he's fine
yeah i like them i don't care for the older you know like the dog left me stuff
no huh-uh i don't even really know who she is you know
you know so but have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like that music that you like to
but aren't they done with i thought that they
and i just thought that they done broke up and
wow i didn't know that
that's interesting
cause they are on up there in age aren't they
oh alright
cause they look pretty rough i mean i've seen like picture of them and they just
yeah i mean cause they just
uh-huh yuck looking i mean
uh-huh well are you into that that rock music you know all that druggy stuff and all that i mean
you know what i am saying like i mean like they come on the stage and like you know you they don't even know they are there you know they are just so out of it
so i just don't i just don't like you know
that so i don't know
um uh
uh so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
i agree uh with with both of those things but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
uh the only prob- the only problem i see with term limitations uh is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you d- can't just send someone off to washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh congress person uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there
yeah but
uh the other the other thing that uh bothers me about our system is just that uh in for for in in in congress the amount of power any any particular congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there so it's you know for you know uh so unless you have actual you know across the board s- uh limitations the uh you know the idea of well we're going to just we're i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
well i mean l- t- i don't see why it makes a big difference the c i a because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative
generally i don't think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched
they don't ever have to go out and get a real job they just
stay in their current job you know what i mean
i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems
uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too i know some senators and i don't know which ones but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties
and i th- they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes
i know they pay taxes but they don't
you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year
which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am
and they work less you know less than i do
i think i think that's true however i think that's always been true
i mean that's true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years and uh
they i mean there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up i think two years is too short
i think it would have to be extended uh you know a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a congressman uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for congress
senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years
uh-huh i think i think that that's true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin
uh the c i a is moving out to west virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency i mean the action isn't in west virginia i hate to tell the s- the senator from west virginia this information but
it really doesn't e- ar- the world does not revolve around west virginia
uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around d c you know
as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and the c i a is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in west virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive
and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that
or is it the f b i i don't remember but i think there's
yeah that's officially
i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh turn- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
but i think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and
they're bouncing checks all over the place
uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
damn it i agree with pretty much with everything you've said uh the one the one thing that i you know i'd advise any parent uh you know or any or any person looking for a college uh is that i think i think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there because you know they're just uh in my experience i've talked to people at other colleges uh that you know the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the cat- catalogs isn't always the whole story
yeah i i go to georgia tech which is you know primarily an engineering school
and uh you know i think i really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not the the you know it tends to be a very conservative school and there and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have
yeah uh i don't really know of anyone that's like look- that's looking for colleges now you know because it with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters then the only advise passed down is don't go to georgia tech
uh but uh no actua- actually i'm i'm i'm more interested in in in choosing the right j- job when you graduate
type information
uh-huh like a fine arts education i
okay well mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college
she's actually at bible college for this current year
and uh i guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program and then it comes down to the dollar you have to uh it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction or *slash error
you know it does *sv it comes down to uh
trying to come with a trade off of the costs
uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to
no y- the the college the the catalogs are sales material
it doesn't matter
whether you know they're they're selling school
and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see
the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school uh i guess there's a difference in here the at least
the university here in saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students like they just live in the community
uh you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well
and that you know that changes the character
of it quite a bit
yeah uh i guess we're here this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas *utt 3 & 4 one utt our engineering students
uh in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates
can give you idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a a spirit of somewhat unkind but
producing graduates
uh you know as sort of some development and some training uh like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them
and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is
uh do you uh have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh feed information to i suppose if you're actually at georgia tech as a student you're a ways away from that
well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need
to consider as well
uh you know to going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the
p- pa- programs person's involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market
jeez if that's
right best training in the world is not going to f- put food on your table
but uh
you have any pets
two dogs what kind
schnauzers is it a miniature or a standard schnauzer
i'm going into all this because i used to w- i just got done working at a pet shop actually
oh yeah
that's good
they say
didn't expect that would happen yeah that's cool that's nice uh let's see what was the other dog you had
oh a sheltie
they can be nippy
yeah shelties are nice everybody seems to be really happy with them they're good temperament
they put up with a lot
schnauzers in particular probably
oh yeah
yeah i g- it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are
yeah the- they're bred down so much it's
they aren't the best pets
yeah i mean some people seem fairly well suited for
for uh miniature poodles and such
pit bull
they might they're actually very friendly dogs
uh they're really nice
i i've dealt with quite a few of them people uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they uh fit collars and stuff on them and they are they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence uh
well because some people uh want to train them as
you really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way
yeah it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really
yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters
and so once you get them going it's not good to to deal with but they i i really like them *two utts i was i was impressed by them they're they're real sturdy little critters and they aren't that big
and uh just really friendly
i was i was
yeah right now
they picked up a lot of bad press lately
well yeah
but any any any pet's going to can can be bad if you train it to be that way
well yeah it's when in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets
because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a k- a child
in a house
i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
and you know they should expect something like that to happen and so bas- now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town
yeah it it bit him
and that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was f- it was a fairly wild ferret
hadn't they hadn't
yeah i mean
they really should have should have expected it
and taken the precautions they didn't
it's too bad it happened though
do i have pets
yes i have a cat and i have two dogs
i have a schnauzer and i have a sheltie
it it's a miniature
oh okay
well the schnauzer i'm i'm watching for one of uh the managers where i work and he's been transferred to germany for a while
and i'm taking care of his dog and uh and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says well my dog doesn't like cats
and i said well we won't tell him it's a c- we won't tell her it's a cat
because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens
they just are fascinated
so she doesn't know that this is a cat yet
and they get along real good i said if tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip *listen
so that was interesting
it's a sheltie
she's real s- sweet little dog she's got a very nice temperament uh they're not as aggressive as a schnauzer
you know the schnauzers are a little aggressive
they're a good temperament
and they and they just uh they i think they have a good head on their shoulders i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that i have encountered
yeah but also some poodles uh
they're kind of there are some smart ones out there but there's some also some uh not so smart ones
yeah that's that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement
i i'd i really don't know
what the best pet is i guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal
um *slash error
and bull dogs
but i don't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called pit bulls pit bulls
that are so vicious
are they really i don't think i've ever
seen one
well how do they become s- w- how did they get their reputation then
oh they train them to be that way then
oh okay
oh okay
oh dear so the
the poor animal is doing it in self protection
oh dear
well that's unusual
huh well i suppose you were surprised
the reputation that you know they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know
yeah they're banned from in some areas i understand
you know that they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're going
oh okay
oh okay
oh did it attack the child then
well the
the people that owned him should have been on the
lookout for that
um *slash error
sure yeah
yeah because then the the animal's in trouble and not the person
well uh i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what
we are supposed to do about this
right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh
especially what for instance george bush is offering
yeah ninety-seven cents a week now what that's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average
middle income person you know another ninety-seven cents hell you can buy a coke or something for that
that ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either
uh i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either especially the democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget
at this point
i believe it was dukakis
but i i can't
yeah i mean that's better than george bush who came out and said no i will not
read my lips or whatever *slash error
and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this *sd(^q
but it seems to me that uh that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know
of x number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go because in my opinion i don't think i'm ever going to see any of this peace so-called peace dividend
i mean if they could actually put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste
money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like
public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
right ex-
and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country
yeah and
and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infra structure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
so am i
uh i u
you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington
yeah uh well it's it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean
they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job
of spending that money
oh no *slash error
uh-huh *b
for for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what george bush's stand on the budget is right now
is that he is saying i am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come november and you'll elect me again
and then i'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said
or you know it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference
no no not at all
yeah it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's
when it's just such a bad time for it
the ninety-seven cents a week
yeah i mean mostly it's it's not actually a a a cut it's just a cut in the withhold in the amount withheld you know
um yeah i don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot
yeah i mean you know in retrospect um was it was it mondale or dukakis that said you know i'll i'll tell you right now i'm going to raise taxes
it was dukakis yeah
i have a lot of respect for him
oh yeah yeah it's it's
oh yeah i uh i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where
it wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly
and it
yeah infra structure is in is in i mean we we we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the
cold war
uh-huh um yeah i i agree totally
um i mean this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen um i i'm in college right now and
oh really where do you go
right i go to georgia tech um
and in what i had pol- you know the required political science class
a couple of years ago and one of the things we discussed was you know where our where the budget situate- how the budget situation just got so out of hand
and essentially what happened was i think it was like in the um tax year of eighty-one um ronald reagan basically said you know i'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the congress would not in their right mind pass
and con- congress realizing that they were going to lose a the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye you know bye-bye removing the tax cut
further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
and you just
i mean it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun
well yeah um what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're we're going to have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
i mean it's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing you know
where people just want want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now you know
uh-huh it i mean i don't know i i don't i don't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninety-seven cents a week
i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive
how do you feel about crime in the city you say you're from atlanta
uh-huh i mean do you do you find crime in atlanta really i live in atlanta also
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
i probably agree with that
yeah that's probably true um so um well do you think atlanta's as bad as most other cities
uh-huh i don't think it's as bad as l a either
we i don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
yeah i don't know i came to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just just keeping your senses about you and and trying not to look like a victim you know
you know walk bi- you know walk with you know with
just walk in a confidently and you know don't don't be
looking around like you've never been there before
and you have no idea where you are
yeah have you have you ever have you ever been mugged in atlanta
yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged um
yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun
and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta
and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
oh really
oh where was where where was that was that downtown or
metropolitan yeah
yeah i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen uh and uh and you know about half the time they seem to the a p d seems to recover them you know
in various states of disrepair
up on blocks my friend had a v w rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in the front seat
well you're probably luckier than
uh-huh um so like does insurance pay for the body damage or
was that all there was body
uh-huh so how do you know this much about um stealing cars
right i i i actually i live in the city
and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh you know for my own safety
well that's right uh *slash error
uh i think it is bad in certain areas *sv however i think the area that i live in it's not uh the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city
i think it seems that there's certain areas where uh the crime is focused
well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility and uh
they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think
you know particularly in some of the housing projects uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused
and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it
um well i've been to i'd say it's it's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime um it's nowhere near as bad as new york city
for example probably not not as bad as detroit
yeah that seems to be true um yeah if you've ever been to like new york city and
you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed
it's that obvious
yeah that's true
with a big stick or
right don't don't walk down a an alley or don't get
just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation
but yeah there are times when you can't avoid all that
and and then you're kind of on your own
uh no the only thing i've ever had was i've had my wallet lifted
but that was in a more of a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got i was much younger at the time
and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really
and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
i've had that happen but that's that's about it
oh yeah
really well i've had my
uh-huh i've had my car stolen so maybe that counts
oh no that was in the northern p- um up near cumberland mall area
it's actually cobb county but it is atlanta
and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area
yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't they didn't strip it
so i got it back
yeah than most
it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
yeah you got to you crack the steering column and you pull the there's a pin in there that you can pull on these g m cars
and you can start it up basically pretty easily
well after i found mine i had to i had this
so how you like new jersey
right i guess uh i don't know what part of new jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial
right uh-huh
well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without e t r emission control systems on their cars and things like that
yeah and it's like
right i guess from what i hear though uh next year ford is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in california
right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick uh i was reading a an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the c f c -s but
uh yeah i think that's a that's a contributor definitely
yeah i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production but
it go ahead
right and that's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense uh in terms of
exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles and it's it's increasing even as far near the equator as like florida and cuba and those places
so it's kind of an interesting situation it's not not a real good one actually
uh-huh yeah
yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time
okay so you've got
yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think
yeah denver's definitely
yeah that's one of the worst
sure yeah denver's that that real good e- that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like mexico city does i guess
mexico city is historically been one of the worst
in the in the world for that but i've been pretty lucky i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in orlando florida and there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver but you can
yeah and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there
there is but it's kind of it's
uh it's pretty good you know you get uh closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
yeah it's when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial
but i'm i'm about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you
don't notice that that other part of
new jersey exists
actually very
y- you know you go even a few wi- miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air
but uh
oh d- definitely it's
uh you know there are a large number of them on the road they're all you know going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
oh e- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year
you get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something
and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
yeah that and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets
so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline
it it is coming from cars though
i mean the uh car air conditioners is
one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon
which is one of the major flor- chlorofar- fluorocarbons
well it it
no it's it's the type of thing there that uh you know the third world countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial
so they're on the different part of the cycle of the u s the u s used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we
got to
well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction
which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and
replacing some of the pollutants
mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between atlanta washing- d c area
well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the
and los angeles and a- rest of california which is just terrible it sounds
yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of
heavy industry you know that would be causing it
okay should begin *listen could probably code if we could tell if it said we or you
uh i can begin this um basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis
and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical
uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself
um what's your situation
are you a professor there
oh i see okay
oh no doubt
right well that's good
yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell is uh i used to work with the army research institute and being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year
so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time
so that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
yeah i don't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed oregon's plan
or the oregon plan
toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical maladies that you can have
and then basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and the ones above would
so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck
but um it was kind of an interesting show
i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing
uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i i don't mind having dental you know sometimes dental costs can be um just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh university of new hampshire handle it
is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or
oh okay
yeah i'm kind of interested because i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree
is to uh is to teach in a university
i'm a doctoral student in florida right now
but uh yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that
oh is that right
okay all right
i work for the university of new hampshire and
uh our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental
no i work in i'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the university of new hampshire
uh so the uh the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time
we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off
well i think uh the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit
and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh
you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part
oh yeah
well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free
and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
uh yes it is the benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that
as opposed to what they call the p a t staff which i belong to
but the main i think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but
the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued
uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's you know based on how long they've worked there
that determines how much uh vacation time they get
college programs belong to this t i a a uh c r e f retirement fund
right and in the case of the university of new hampshire uh
what's your view
what's your view
yeah that's true
you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know
i don't know coming from texas you're probably i don't know i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
oh you're just live down there
oh well
yeah well i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and
man there's no way there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know
it doesn't sit with me very well i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty-eight in my truck you know
yeah i just about all well i live in minneapolis and i well actually i live in florida but i am staying in minneapolis for a year and
you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
and it's just you never know who is out there
you know it's just for self protection purposes and then of course there's the hunting issue so
yeah that's good what do you do jeff
oh yeah
all right
i'm uh researcher of honeywell up here
so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or
yeah you know
that's something i miss quite a bit
yeah all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh for a complete
that's right
i guess i am about eight or nine
yeah no doubt about it but uh
yeah if there's
if there's a way you know to limited it to people that i don't know that they i guess they passed a couple of uh uh laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period
where you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually uh i know it's this way in florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week
and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea uh and that's i don't know that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always be able to get around but uh
yeah it's one of things but uh i don't know i guess i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon
yeah i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting
you know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve
you know you might do the same thing
and so it's like i don't know it does it takes the sport out of it for me i would much rather have a bow anytime
i i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know
but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business
but uh i don't know anyway that's about where i stand
you uh
and you uh have you eaten yet or whatever
is it seven o'clock there
you guys central
oh it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees
and it's been up around forty so people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so
i am just up here for the year and it's kind of shocking
all right
well i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns
i mean
that's right that's right
yeah it is but i'm not really from i'm not really from texas i just live down here now i've
i've lived down here a couple years
i'm originally from colorado but yeah
there uh there uh there's a lot of hunters here
i just think i think it's ridiculous
i mean
uh i i'm in uh program control for a company up here
we do schedules for
programs schedule programs what do you do
oh okay
uh i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here i don't own a shotgun but i'd like to go bird hunting
yeah uh when i was in colorado we went deer and elk hunting
you you know quite a bit but
one for a total ban
and uh
yeah i i agree with you there
i mean if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't
i you know i'm not
for it
yeah i don't either
yeah i
fully auto but even well i mean a semiautomatic i guess that's
yeah right
oh really
me too
yeah i am about the same way
uh yeah it's about seven fifteen
how is the weather up there
is it
wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case
and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh let me ask you the question do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
i see i see well good i'm kind of in a different situation but i i i went through that too when i was in school but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that but uh
i'm married and have uh a a couple of children and
we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget i'm on a salary so i don't get any overtime or anything like that but
we have a fixed income and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have will is spent accordingly and uh what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is
we pretty much have you know the house payment we have the insurance premiums uh utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll- the kids education
college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds and and we also set aside an emergency fund because
we've uh we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something
happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for
and uh then we have you know whatever's left over is disposable in- disposable dis- yeah discretionary income
that we use for the rest of the month so and it's worked out very well it's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and
uh try and stick with that and nice thing about it i my wife is is excellent in that we both work together we both have a budget and we stick to it
and there's no surprises in that
well actually i have four kids
so yeah i said a couple of kids i i guess i should have specified i have four
four little boys yeah
you bet
you bet
all right
well good good
yes well what year are you in in college
you're a sophomore so you have a few more years
uh-huh well good for you good for you yeah i imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth
well great great and sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too
lab fees and all
oh yes oh yes well you're not a starving artist yet are you
well good
the- there's enough of those in the world huh
good good i'm glad to hear that wendy w-
who's who's not very well educated
oh yes yes
that's true that's true i found that out
so that's why i'm planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also
try and set that money aside
i majored in business administration
yeah but uh once again
right now i'm in college and i'm on work study
and so my budget comes from my dad's help
he helps me out a lot and i get paid monthly so that's kind of hard to have a budget my mother uh doesn't get paid much money so her budget is uh just uh planning for i r a's
that sounds good
well that's good
well good
with two kids that could be hard
oh my goodness
four boys
oh my goodne-
it's just me and my sister
and my parents divorced three years ago
and my sister had gotten through college but i was still in high school and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together
and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college
but uh when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house
so now my dad's paying for all of my college of
and financial aid
and scholarships i'm a music major so i have auditions coming up
i'm a sophomore
right right i'll i'll probably have about two two and a half years left
oh it sure is i i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks
and i and i don't spend over that
oh sure there's there's always music
books to buy
oh no no no
i don't plan on being a starving artist
that's why i'm in college
that's usually because they're not real educated they can't afford to have a really good job
the starving ones
there's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough then you can make money
what did you major in
well good you know plenty about planning a b- a budget
do you have any
all right
oh that's good you don't often find that i don't think
sure there's a okay uh that's interesting yeah the only pet that i've had uh i'm a i'm a doctoral student right now
and in my in my earlier days as a student i kind of time shared on a dog with a a good friend of mine and uh it was an amazing dog it really was they had he had gotten it from the pound and uh it it's a spanish pointer named domino
kind of looks like a dom- a dalmatian
and we trained it from a pup and basically it right now it it's fully trained and it can do a lot of things it will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff so it's really it's it's kind of a show piece any- -more and whenever anybody comes over we all have to show him domino you know
yeah it's uh she's been a real good a real good dog and uh just it's kind of a shame that i'm i'm go- i'm away from it now i i j- i actually live in florida
but i'm on an internship up here for a year and then i go back down but uh yeah domino's a real good dog
uh what uh possessed you to get the dog
sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that
that's good that kind of builds some
character a little bit
yeah that's something that's important for sure
i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh
oh i see
it's not that big of a problem with domino she was full grown i would estimate seventy pounds
and you know we lived in oviedo which is a small town it's a suburb of orlando
but there's not there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run so that was the biggest problem i saw and i think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or s- you know i guess you can't really say for cats me and cats don't get along too well uh but you know that whole space issue i think is real important
yeah that that
sure and that's all part of y- of keeping your part of the relationship
you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues
you know and also the whole whole thing with noise my mother oh she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them
and you know we h- we had a neighbor in nebraska when we lived there that had uh brittany spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin with but uh
yes we do have a pet we have a a dog that we got from the uh well we call it the s p c a it's the uh an- from an animal shelter
uh he'd come in there as a stray
uh he's a pomeranian and sheltie cross
uh well he was very well trained when we got him uh he's
no uh we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident
because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him
and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him
oh yeah
oh i think so
well i guess in one sense we felt that it it's nice to have a dog even though there are you know complications come with it
and then with our children uh at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight so
it was an age where it was uh we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet
yeah right
well that's the idea i think the reality of it is that they perhaps uh it depends on the
on everyone's discipline
and uh from that aspect i'm short on the discipline because i don't uh enforce that the kids look after the dog and uh we've had him about four years now
uh but i think it does it it you know it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh
actually no we live in a in an area that's oh probably about two and a half miles from the university
uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area
and uh so that is not as good uh you know this dog being a small dog it's uh more you more acceptable
but again
yeah it's uh that's one of the biggest concerns it's like uh there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of
of the animal
and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise
uh greg uh i i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in indiana don't you have the the death penalty
uh-huh uh i i tend to agree with you uh i've changed my views over uh e- even within the last few years uh to be honest uh uh when i was in coll- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international
and uh and of course at that time you know i thought uh uh it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
but the uh the more now i live in downtown dallas and i uh
you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
i think that maybe uh a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder
yeah uh
yeah it seems sensible and failsafe i i uh i don't you know not completely failsafe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
uh i also uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is
i've kind of chosen uh i believe it that uh big time drug importers like uh say noriega for example
that these people need to be uh eliminated uh
from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure
uh-huh well uh do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital the capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced
that's true yeah
sure yeah i understand i understand your point yeah uh of course you know with uh with with dahlmer now uh you you realize that ohi- i think it's ohio uh gets to try him next and
they do have the death penalty
yeah so uh that was a curious case i
uh uh something is sort of nightmarish
to say the least
uh well here in texas we uh i think even even this last week last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often but we do have it
i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh
seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
but i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that
which seems pretty sensible
right yeah
yeah you're you're right there uh i gue- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented
in that i just you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail
when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
well i i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i mean i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
and in that case wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing god
which is n- never a good thing to do
but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or
serial killers
uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like noriega and such as that i think that they're they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think that that it's it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because
they're feeding our consumer needs
yeah that is very curious
that's that's right
steve this is like i mentioned brian and i guess we're going to want to be talking about child care uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care
well uh we're kind of lucky i i'm uh i'm working my wife isn't working and she is taking care of the kids also and and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh co-workers and associates that are looking for child care and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know uh guidance counselor to student or you know uh adult to child relationship how many
you know you don't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult then
uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well
and uh they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time so you know depends also upon the the level of the child we uh we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid
and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel uh that the kids interact with other children also it's a it's a good way to develop
relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
right right
i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere i want to trust the people
and uh you know you hear in the newspa- you hear on the t v and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile so
that's true that's true
well steven it's been
well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care
our kids are now fourteen and eighteen
but uh and so you know you go back those many years and uh we didn't do it very much
we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time
and our kids were older but i've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
uh so it my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using
how about yourself
yeah i i kind of think that uh you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care
but even you know here i guess we have in one sense two forms of uh child care there's where individuals will in one primarily babysit
children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children
and then otherwise there will be the majority are co-operative day-cares uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care and the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be
but at the same time there's some fairly good training programs and and some of them formal two year programs
uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
yeah you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here
and i guess you know it are it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home
or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not and it's more of a group home rather than
actually day-care s- type of facility
what do you do there in lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned
oh yeah wha-
what would be more efficient about it wha- what
i see
yeah i i i uh was going to say cause i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it
you know and uh if
if i have a if i i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
that's true
certainly that's a good idea
well uh as far as t i is concerned i'm not sure uh and i have heard you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i have heard in residential situations uh like in plano
uh that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up
where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper uh and aluminum and uh the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department
right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items
well wh- what kind of services do you have there in lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items *should this be part of the above slash unit i i lived in abilene for a uh i went to school there at abilene christian and i it was so hard to uh you know if you
you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible
well that's good
uh-huh do you tend to buy more recycled items that if something uh the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or
sure yeah
well you know they actually started and i assumed it was t i wide uh they they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper
uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper
i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or
a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
you know where i use to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them
and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step
kind of type thing
right but somebody still has to collect all that
and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full you close the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and
i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it's feasible
so uh what else do they do in the dallas area
anything extra
that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the the even uh there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your
you know vegetable things come in and uh so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i want to set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most
uh but
find a place
well uh uh they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans those are the two major items you know we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh uh dump areas like at the fire departments
throughout town
uh i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans
uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles
things like that
uh but i i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments
i do that i think people are becoming more aware
you know of of the waste and you know i i like to see you know you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper
and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it you know maybe it's making an impact
i'm not as good about searching something out like that
but if i am there and the choice is there
i would probably take the recycled product
so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way
so uh you know they are getting away from the styrofoam
uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months
well it's kind of hard to say uh because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years we just
bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty-nine
and uh wait a minute we bought one in ninety we've got three cars of all things
so uh probably we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan
uh we have a a mazda nine twenty nine and a ford crown victoria and a little two seater c r x
uh it's rather difficult to to project what kind of uh we'd look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh report or uh repair records that the various cars have
and then of course we look into the prices
and uh f- uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them uh long- a longer period of time uh i traded off an eighty-two oldsmobile for the eighty-nine mazda
so uh
uh yeah yeah we we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life and uh we we've had a good many foreign cars
and uh they they uh i've been extremely we've had three mazdas we've been extremely pleased with our mazdas
yeah well we we've had uh let's see we had uh we had a uh let me think pause we had a fifty-three and a uh we had uh two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story
uh and we had a sixty-five and then we had this eighty-two
so we we really can't complain about oldsmobiles really
uh my son over in shreveport uh sold porsches audis mad- mazdas and volkswagons for ten years and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the mazdas
uh so uh the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy-seven m g m g b
was british gr- racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top
and uh i drove it mostly
yeah it really was my husband was in the air force and we got transferred to okinawa
so uh we had to sell it w- which really tore me up
because uh it it w- it was great fun and then uh when we got to okinawa well we bought a second hand we uh we decided that uh we had this uh sixty-five oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the states and we got a little fiat uh and a and the little uh forty horse power mazda four door sedan
have you done this very long
yeah that's the same with us
well what kind of car would you buy
oh okay
okay what kind do you have now
oh okay
oh uh-huh
and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic
oh really
we've always bought american made cars mostly oldsmobiles
yeah we've been real pleased with ours i think we've had one two three
and most we have a cutlass we still have a cutlass supreme which is like a seventy-seven
then we have a cutlass sierra and we've had the ninety-eight
so but i don't know we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they
give good financing through the the motor company
but i don't know what we're going to buy i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty
oh the
ooh boy
i'll bet
it was hard to part with that
oh yeah
so what do you think about caring for older folks dale
very definitely
well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old they aren't really that old but they are sort of wearing out my mamma is a dialysis patient
and she is only about sixty-four but she's had some pretty close calls and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now and so she's phasing out sounds like and but she's also a very very very independent person and doesn't like having having people uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
uh i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly
couldn't never see him in a nursing home
and my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home he's ninety i think right on ninety right now
and he's living by himself my grand mamma died a couple of years ago
so but he's you know as long as you can have the families take care of the people i'd like to see them stay at home
right especially for your uncle i bet
now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with alzheimer do they have anything like that in dallas
right so they are pretty limited
oh another interesting thing another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa- well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives
to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities
i don't think that was mainly with alzheimer's patients but just patients people in general who were not as independent as they use to be
uh-huh very faint
right to uh get there and to participate in the activities
that's true you can't play those things
but you can sing songs and uh
and tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about your was it your grand mother
that was having alzheimer
uh being able to tell old stories you can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way
do they like to listen to other people recollect though
well that is good because we
well i think uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for
they've got a lot of special needs and at the same time uh the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have
and so you've got a real balance to make there
what about you
very faint
oh really
oh okay
yeah but it gets hard my my grandmother is in her mid eighties
and she's uh suffering from uh well uh progressive alzheimer's disease
so she doesn't remember anybody
and uh she remembers things but they are things back whenever she was real young
and so with she was living by herself but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
and it's creating a lot of problems
oh yes yes
in dallas uh yeah i've i've heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up
oh really
uh-huh uh-huh well it it's it's a really day care programs are really neat you know and if the if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active
and their body just hasn't kept up with them
and i think that's in a way it's more some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those
right cause i know there's one not too far from from me here in dallas uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work
and sports
but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly
yeah you can't do it
well that's true
and they love to recollect i mean they just you know and they will just go on and on with these stories and they have such a memory
my grandmother doesn't
she she wants to te- to tell you about her story over again so
which is fine you know so
um so what do you think
oh really
i- that is uh that is something i've heard uh i had a friend uh that i worked with that was from sweden and that was uh probably the the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field but at the same time it's real hard i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance and so you know i'm real you know it's like well you know you know there's got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know i hate to uh the the competition i- in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and and uh they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there's a you know they're regulating themselves and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for my i have a brother who's a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um
you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous and i don't think that is that is uh abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and
i don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
i- yeah and so i- i- it's i think i- to me i think uh something that's going to help our medical uh arena is for um and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and and you've got to uh keep up or you've got to realize that you know i- it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions and they will make mistakes and e- e- you know i- if people you know i- there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can't you know you can't say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and um i don't know i i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically um
in the in the last number of years and i think that's something that if if they could work on the cause of that and
i lived i lived in sweden for two years
and in sweden they have socialized medicine and so i saw some of the good and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program
uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
so it's a very it's a very uh comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life
um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden
because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but uh if you're if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long-term disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that
also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh uh i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses
all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it would be lower middle-class housing here it's probably middle-class housing there
um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver
and so their their incomes were about the same
whereas here there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward
and that that didn't exist in sweden
and uh overall i gue- their their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was less professional and it was treated more
like a like a taxi driver type job
then a then a doctor type job
you don't think it's abnormal
oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common
well it's uh i'll start off here uh i don't know i get probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from c n n uh i like c n n because it uh you know repeats it well headline news repeats every half hour but it
makes it really convenient cause i keep a rather hectic schedule and uh but the newspaper p- provides a little bit of depth
that you can't really get from
right yeah i know the my only major objection is that uh i don't think american media spends enough uh attention on on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada uh
uh-huh yeah
right yeah i mean you know canada has gone through a lot of problems now with with quebec and and everything and uh it's amazing that you know i i listen to d c area and the washington post you know i mean the most they'll give it is the back of the a section
uh you know
yeah definitely
right exactly yeah i uh spent this past summer up in canada uh well part of it touring and uh you know i- i was amazed cause i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on there's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a a canada you know in the next five years
you know because of the problems with quebec and n- i had never heard any of that before
right right
oh yeah
yeah uh i i guess i've never seen the t v show i used to get the uh
right yeah
i i think i'd agree a a s- similar method of getting the news with me too it's uh uh c n n has been a welcome addition to the t v scene here in the
last uh number of years uh p- prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts
uh just usually pretty local in in nature and and i like uh c n n because you get some world world events too
uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth
that that's true you know you hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other wor- news events going on in either of those countries
uh whereas if you pick up a a european paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries soviet union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them
i'm i'm currently living in dallas and it it won't even give it the back section you just
never see you just never see anything about it uh which is a shame because you go to other countries uh and and they carry quite a bit about the u s on the other hand and if you go up to uh canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the
news u s and we're pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in canada or mexico
you just don't know what's going on
i'd i every once in awhile i have to travel overseas and lately i've taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh around and picking up the b b c and it's sort of like uh a c n n too you
you can tune into some stations and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events uh i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all
there's not much in the way of television in some
of those places uh but that's a good point about about the neighboring countries i hadn't really thought about it but i guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it
yeah you know there was a a what is it called is it meech lake accord
or or i- that's just something uh i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in calgary a couple of years ago and you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and and c- came it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers
i didn't see a thing about it so it's uh we've got a long ways to go i guess it's improved and like i say with c n n and and uh the cable news even even there's uh uh it's sor- it's semireligious in some respects but what is it it's uh i mean it's news is not not that way uh oh i'm trying to think of the channel the the christian science monitor
uh i it surprised me i've caught it a few times and they they do some pretty good news uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts uh
uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising you'd think it would carry mostly religious but it it doesn't seem to so i'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than c n n might be covering uh some more in- interest type topics in in other countries but it's kind of world world uh network too
a uh golden retriever
is it really
we've had him for let's see he just had his fourth birthday
yeah and we got him when he was about eight weeks old and uh he's pretty okay we like him
he does that's the one thing we don't like about him in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off
he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that
he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything and they put him on the scale and he's up to ninety four now
but he's not a real he's not a real tall uh dog for a golden retriever he's kind of stocky shorter and stockier
he is it's uh just me and my wife and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids
we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten
because i
get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
how about you
that's probably a good idea they're good though uh have you ever had a retriever before
because i i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial they like to play
especially with the kids they love to play with kids
no he's pretty much an inside dog
he stays in we we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside
he's really a wimp
and when it comes to being alone uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that but he does not like to be tied outside he'll he'll just bark and bark and bark
no he's uh taken to the training pretty well and uh he knows where our yard is and we have a pretty small yard but he seems to know the boundaries
and he usually is good about staying within them although our next door neighbors have a dog too and uh she she is good friends with my dog
and so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff but
he's pretty good he stays out of the street and uh if i catch him i call him and he comes back so he he's pretty good about taking to commands and
and things
we never did
i i trained him on my own and uh this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult
we've had kid or we've had dogs when i was a kid but this this is the first one that i uh took in so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well i
never really to hit him or anything just you know
firm tone of voice and those
sorts of things i i see other people out there and they hit their dogs and try to and and those horrible collars that they put on them with invinc- invisible fencing least i
invisible fencing have you heard of that
it's uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard
at the perimeter and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it and if they get too close to that perimeter it
it zaps them
yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to so he held on to the collar and he walked out to the perimeter he said it was a good jolt
yeah and so i i don't take too well to to those
sorts of training techniques i don't think they're always necessary if you put enough patience into
it's uh is your cat an indoor cat or an
outdoor cat
somebody just told me that
because of the leukemia
quite a difference
what uh what kind of climate do you have
ooh that's
one of my favorite kinds of dogs
how long have you had it
fourth birthday
does he shed a lot
how much does he weigh now
is he good with family
yeah i can
understand that
well we have a cat who's also about four years old
and he's our spoiled child right now too
and he also sheds a lot
but we uh we hope to get a golden retriever someday but we figure we'll get the kids and then the the dog
no but my husband had one when he was growing up
is is your dog an inside and outdoors
oh really
um when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back
oh yeah
did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or
train him on your own and
invisible what
no what is that
i'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog
oh really
yeah just be consistent and diligent
with it and um
he's indoor and all declawed because i know the uh average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months
yeah that and also just uh getting hit i guess or getting beat up and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
well uh it's we just moved recently so now we're in the uh dallas area and it's very
very nice and
