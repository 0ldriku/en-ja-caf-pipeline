one day tom was sitting under the tree
playing with his bubble maker
with the bubble maker he made a kangaroo a car and fruits and so on
he made as many as stuffs
they could think
that he could think of
than he blew a hues bubble
and made it into a snake
it was so scary
so he blew up
he blew he made hues cat bigger than the snake
to scare the snake away
and finally he made a huge bubble
and transform it into an elephant
to scare the cat away
he was so excited
to see the elephant winning the cat
then when he tried
to make something
the elephant was scared of
thinking
what he's gonna make
and he just ran away
without seeing
what's what's going to happen now
after playing with bubbles tom was fed up with
making things
and just drew the bubble bubble juice away ants
he threw damn all in the
