  "transcript": "One day, Jimmy was walking in the forest. Jimmy has lived in the forest for quite a long time, for two years now, but um he never found anything interesting there. But this day was an exception. Jimmy found a hat, black hat. It was a cylinder, so at first it interested him extremely. So he decided to pick it up and try it on. And though he didn't have any mirror around him, uh he was able to find a pond to see how it looks like, and he liked it. So he decided to keep it. After all, everyone should um take care about his image, right? So he put on the hat and kept walking through the forest. He wanted other inhabitants to see him and greet him, and also to see what cool hat he got. And walking by this fashion, he met his old friend Penny. And Penny saw him wearing this hat, this big cylinder, and it was big enough that uh it covered half of his head and all of his forehead. She started laughing at him, make fun of him, and ridicule him. So the end, he got offended, and he threw, he took off his hat and threw it away, because he just uh couldn't take it any longer. But Penny did what she wanted to do. She took fancy in in this hat almost immediately, and that was her plan to make Jimmy the bird get rid of this hat. So when the Jimmy left, when Jimmy left, she took the hat and went home. She finally found what she's been looking for such a long time, because it was a time to have babies now, but she uh couldn't quite decide where her nest will be. So when she found the cylinder, it was so convenient for her to have a nest now. After a while, Jimmy accidentally saw her.And he was furious, because he finally understood that Penny made fun of him not because the head was funny, but because she wanted him to get rid of it so she could have it. So it occurred to him all at once, and he felt very frustrated and was determined to get it back. So he went to the place where Penny sat and took the cylinder from her. She took by surprise. She never expected anybody. Well, Jimmy looked angry, and he really wasn't one to argue with, so he just took his head and put it on. But what happened is that there was already a baby in the nest, Penny's baby, and so the Jimmy Jimmy felt that there was something wrong, that he has something on his head, and so when he took off the cylinder, it turned out that the little bird who was crying Mama was sitting on his head. Of course he couldn't be angry anymore, seeing how Penny was happy, how she greeted him, how glad she was, and after all, the cylinder that he found served a very good purpose. So though he felt frustrated at the moment, but nonetheless she got a baby and a good nest for that time, and now he's gonna have a hat. So that was a little story about the accident that happened in the woods between Jimmy and Penny, two friends. I'm done.",
