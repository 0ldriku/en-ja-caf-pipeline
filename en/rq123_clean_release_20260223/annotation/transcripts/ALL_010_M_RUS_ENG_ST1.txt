well there was once a mutant penguin it was a mixture between a penguin and a monkey and that penguin was working in a circus and well one day he escaped from the circus and he was wandering about in the countryside and when he walked on the road he suddenly found his own hat that hat that he was used to perform with it he was very happy about it because it was a magic hat once he put it on he become a man he can speak like a man you can walk like a man and you look like a man and he put it on himself but suddenly he realized that he looks just like a mutant penguin actually a mixture between a penguin and a monkey so steadily he continued his journey when he bumped into a bird it was a mutant bird that was a result of unsuccessful experiment of a biological laboratory and when the bird saw him it said oh you look just like my father actually my father were was was wearing the exactly the same hat as you're wearing now our mutant penguin was really upset about that fact because he knew that the hat belong belonged to only one man and he suddenly realized that he probably has a brother that mutant bird the only thing that he could think of doing at that moment was to run away and to search for his father and clarify that issue whether or not he has a twin brother at the same time the mutant bird took the hat and tried to to make a nest out of it and he actually succeeded but he didn't knew he didn't know that our mutant penguin is watching and the instance the nest was populated with a baby bird the mutant penguin jumped out of the bushes and took away the hat he grabbed the hat and put it on his head because he was expecting a baby and actually the baby came out of the hat and it was their mutual baby the mutual baby of two mutants the penguin who was actually a mixture between a penguin and a monkey and the mutant bird who just had very long legs and they lived happily ever after the end
