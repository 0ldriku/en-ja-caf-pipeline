there was once a creature
walking in the jungle
who found a hat
lying around
he liked the hat
and took it
put it on his head
and started
walking in the jungle
while he was walking behind the tree
there was a bird
standing
the bird seemed
to like the hat
and started
making fun of the creature
the creature dropped the hat
and left it
because he figured
it didn't look any good on him
the bird being clever took the hat then
and layed its eggs in the hat
after the creature realized he
that was conned into
leaving the hat there
in the was then picked up by the bird
to lay the eggs
and make nest
he snatched the hat from the bird
as soon as he put the hat on his head
he realized
that the eggs had hatched
and there were small birds on his head
