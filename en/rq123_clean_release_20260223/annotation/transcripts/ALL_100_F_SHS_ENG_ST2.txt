there was a little boy sitting by a tree blowing bubbles so he started creating something out of his bubbles like a kangaroo and a car and a snake and an elephant and then there was a cat and it started going after the snake and the snake was running away so he made an elephant and now there was the cat was actually like a jaguar and the little bird then created like a little mice for the elephant to run away and so the bubbles are now being popped and going into the sky and the little boy is still by the tree trying to create something else with the bubbles he has left what he does create is a little sea monster but he doesn't realize it because he walks away and throws the bubble maker into the trash can
