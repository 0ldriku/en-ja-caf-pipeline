  subordinate_acl:relcl     | which should follow the snake
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that animal was a tiger

  coordinated_vp            | and the tiger got afraid of the elephant
  subordinate_advcl         | so that also the tiger ran away with the elephant behind him

  subordinate_advcl         | so at first it interested him extremely
  subordinate_advcl         | so he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to pick it up
  coordinated_vp            | and try it on
  subordinate_advcl         | and though he didn't have any mirror around him
  parataxis                 | he was able
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to find a pond
  subordinate_advcl         | to see
  subordinate_ccomp         | how it looks like
  coordinated_vp            | and he liked it
  subordinate_advcl         | so he decided

  parataxis                 | everyone should take care about his image right
  subordinate_advcl         | so he put on the hat
  nonfinite_xcomp           | and kept walking through the forest
  parataxis                 | he wanted other inhabitants
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to see him
  coordinated_vp            | and greet him
  coordinated_vp            | and also to see
  subordinate_ccomp         | what cool hat he got
  subordinate_advcl         | and walking by this fashion
  coordinated_vp            | he met his old friend penny

  subordinate_ccomp         | him wearing this hat this big cylinder
  parataxis                 | and it was big enough
  subordinate_advcl         | that it covered half of his head and all of his forehead
  parataxis                 | she started
  nonfinite_xcomp           | laughing at him
  subordinate_advcl         | make fun of him
  coordinated_vp            | and ridicule him
  parataxis                 | so the end he got offended
  coordinated_vp            | and he took off his hat
  coordinated_vp            | and threw it away
  subordinate_advcl         | because he just couldn't take it any longer
  coordinated_vp            | but penny did what
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | she wanted to do
  parataxis                 | she took fancy in this hat almost immediately
  parataxis                 | and that was her plan
  subordinate_acl           | to make jimmy the bird
  nonfinite_xcomp           | get rid of this hat
  subordinate_advcl         | so when jimmy left
  parataxis                 | she took the hat
  coordinated_vp            | and went home
  parataxis                 | she finally found what
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | she's been looking for such a long time
  subordinate_advcl         | because it was a time
  subordinate_acl           | to have babies now
  coordinated_vp            | but she couldn't quite decide
  parataxis                 | where her nest will be
  subordinate_advcl         | so when she found the cylinder
  parataxis                 | it was so convenient for her
  subordinate_csubj         | to have a nest now
  subordinate_advcl         | after a while jimmy accidentally saw her
  parataxis                 | and he was furious
  subordinate_advcl         | because he finally understood
  subordinate_ccomp         | that penny made fun of him
  subordinate_advcl         | not because the head was funny
  coordinated_vp            | but because she wanted him
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to get rid of it
  subordinate_advcl         | so she could have it
  subordinate_advcl         | so it occurred to him all at once
  coordinated_vp            | and he felt very frustrated
  parataxis                 | and was determined
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to get it back
  subordinate_advcl         | so he went to the place
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | where penny sat
  coordinated_vp            | and took the cylinder from her
  parataxis                 | she took by surprise
  parataxis                 | she never expected anybody
  parataxis                 | jimmy looked angry and he really wasn't one
  subordinate_acl           | to argue with
  subordinate_advcl         | so he just took his head
  coordinated_vp            | and put it on
  parataxis                 | but what happened
  coordinated_vp            | is that there was already a baby in the nest penny's baby
  coordinated_vp            | and so jimmy felt
  subordinate_ccomp         | that there was something wrong
  subordinate_acl           | that he has something on his head and so
  subordinate_advcl         | when he took off the cylinder
  coordinated_vp            | it turned out that the little bird
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | who was crying mama
  subordinate_ccomp         | was sitting on his head
  subordinate_advcl         | of course he couldn't be angry anymore
  subordinate_ccomp         | seeing how penny was happy
  subordinate_advcl         | how she greeted him
  parataxis                 | how glad she was
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | and after all the cylinder that he found
  coordinated_vp            | served a very good purpose
  subordinate_advcl         | so though he felt frustrated at the moment
  coordinated_vp            | but nonetheless she got a baby and a good nest for that time
  coordinated_vp            | and now he's gonna have a hat
  parataxis                 | so that was a little story about the accident
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that happened in the woods between jimmy and penny two frien

  coordinated_vp            | but then he thought
  subordinate_advcl         | what if i try a little bit harder
  coordinated_vp            | and he tried to elaborate
  coordinated_vp            | and it turned out
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he could blow kangaroo
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that is pretty exciting

  subordinate_advcl         | what if i can make the same way almost anything
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | i want

  coordinated_vp            | he always managed
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to do that

  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he wanted
  parataxis                 | so that was really fun
  coordinated_vp            | but then he decided
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to try something different
  parataxis                 | he was blowing
  coordinated_vp            | and blowing and blowing bubble
  coordinated_vp            | and then it turned out

  subordinate_ccomp         | the snake looked
  subordinate_advcl         | as if it were alive

  subordinate_advcl         | looking at billy
  coordinated_vp            | so billy decided
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he would make somebody else
  subordinate_acl           | to chase the serpent
  subordinate_advcl         | because the serpent looked unfriendly
  coordinated_vp            | and billy just wanted
  nonfinite_xcomp           | to make sure
  subordinate_ccomp         | that he's safe
  subordinate_advcl         | so he made an even bigger cat

  subordinate_ccomp         | what he has done
  parataxis                 | he did not expect himself being so good at this
  coordinated_vp            | so cat broke loose
  subordinate_advcl         | to chase the serpent
  parataxis                 | and serpent disappeared
  subordinate_advcl         | but then when billy recovered
  coordinated_vp            | he thought
  subordinate_advcl         | maybe if i could make a cat
  subordinate_ccomp         | i could make even something bigger like an elephant
  coordinated_vp            | and he did it
  coordinated_vp            | and how happy he felt
  subordinate_ccomp         | he loved elephants a lot
  coordinated_vp            | and now he had one of his own
  parataxis                 | it was big and white

  nonfinite_xcomp           | chasing the cat

  coordinated_vp            | but he could think of nothing

  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he would make

  subordinate_acl:relcl     | he wanted
  nonfinite_xcomp           | he tried
  coordinated_vp            | he could manage nothing

  subordinate_advcl         | that he was scared
  subordinate_ccomp         | the cat would get angry at him too
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | so the solution he thought
  subordinate_ccomp         | would be the best

  subordinate_advcl         | that would scare the cat this time

  subordinate_advcl         | so he took a very important decision in his life
  subordinate_acl:relcl     | that he thought
