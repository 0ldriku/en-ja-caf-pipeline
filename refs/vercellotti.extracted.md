                                                            clauses can reach the complexity of finite clauses by the production of another element, making 
                                                            these constructions commensurate with subordinate finite clauses. Since these constructions are

                                                            definition requires an arbitrary division along a continuum of complex verbal constructions, the 
                                                            field  should adopt this broader definition of clause. Further, researchers should clarify their 
                                                            methodology choices and acknowledge coding challenges, which are common in L2 data, espe-

                                                            pretation of research results and facilitates comparisons across L2 studies.   
                With accuracy and fluency, complexity is often considered a hallmark of second language (L2) proficiency (Norris & Ortega, 2009), 
            and, as a result, complexity is often a focus of L2 research (Pallotti, 2015). To capture syntactic complexity, L2 researchers have 
            employed many different measures (Norris & Ortega, 2009; Pallotti, 2015). Specifically, L2 researchers have often used clause-based 
            measures (e.g., el Majidi, de Graaff & Janssen, 2021; Vercellotti, 2018). Researchers, however, seldom define how clause is oper-
            ationalized in the coding (e.g., Ahmadian, Tavakoli & Dastjerdi, 2015; Leonard & Shea, 2017; Skehan, Bui, Wang & Shum, 2024). For 
            instance, Leonard and Shea (2017: p. 182) described their coding of syntactic complexity as “subordinate clauses were marked,” and 
            Ahmadian et al. (2015: p. 48) stated that syntactic complexity was calculated as “the ratio of clauses to [analysis of speech] AS-units.”

            tations. Still, vagueness obscures relevant coding choices, hinders the interpretation of research findings, and impedes meaningful 
            comparisons across research studies. 
                This paper’s first section explains the importance of clearly defining clause in language research articles. The second section reviews 
            a continuum of complex verbal constructions, using examples from existing L2 speech data, and justifies which constructions reach 
            clause status. The third and four sections, respectively, review some coding complications in learner data and in speech data, as such 
            data do not always match the forms given in grammar books. The final section summarizes a broader definition of clause, which both

           captures clausal complexity and facilitates the consistent coding of clauses across L2 research studies. 
           Clause coding choices skew measures of complexity and beyond 
              Norris and Ortega (2009) stated that generally researchers have used measures of length and measures of subordination to capture 
           syntactic complexity. Some measures, including mean clause length and clauses per sentence, are dependent on what counts as a 
           clause. If clause is operationalized more narrowly (e.g., finite verbs with an overt subject), there will be fewer coded clauses, but the 
           average clause length will be higher. Conversely, if a broader definition of clause is chosen (e.g., both finite and nonfinite clauses), the 
           number of clauses will increase while the mean clause length decreases as the number of words will be averaged across a larger number 
           of (smaller) units. The effect on the calculation is obvious, and perhaps seemingly minor, but the size of the difference depends upon 
           the number of constructions that are included or excluded, which is not negligible when looking more closely. For instance, the 
           production of nonfinite clauses has been found to align with proficiency (e.g., Vercellotti, 2018; Vercellotti & Packer, 2016), which 
           means the inclusion or exclusion of nonfinite clauses in the clause-based calculations will be consequential with longitudinal data or 
                                                                                    ´
           data elicited from advanced learners. Furthermore, since many studies (e.g., Bulte & Roothooft, 2020, De Jong & Vercellotti, 2016; el 
           Majidi et al., 2021; Leonard & Shea, 2017; McManus, Mitchell & Tracy-Ventura, 2021; Skehan et al., 2024) have operationalized 
           complexity as a subordination ratio, readers need to understand which subordinate clauses were included in that calculation for results 
           to be interpreted and compared across L2 studies. 
              Moreover, the clause coding choices can affect other language performance measures. Measures of accuracy can be dependent on 
           the coding of clauses in research studies where accuracy is operationalized as percentage of error-free clauses (e.g., De Jong & Ver-
           cellotti, 2016; el Majidi et al., 2021; McManus et al., 2021; Skehan et al., 2024; Vercellotti, 2017). Even measures of fluency can be 
           dependent on the definition of clause when the fluency measure considers whether pausing occurs at a clause boundary (e.g., Leonard 
           & Shea, 2017). Hence, the coding of clauses could have implications for researching accuracy and fluency as well as complexity. 
           Which clauses count? 
              According to Vajjala and Meurers (2012: 167), “a clause is any structure with a subject and a finite verb.” Given this definition, 
           clause coding may seem straightforward, but there are several issues to consider. We interrogate both parts of this definition to argue 
           that other verbal constructions have similar complexity and syntactic structure as a prototypical clause. Specifically, this section re-
                                                                                              2 
           views constructions with coordination, nonfinite verbs, and small clauses, using examples
                                                                                                produced by low-advanced English L2 
           learners during a speaking task. 
              First, coordination is a basic way of increasing complexity (Norris & Ortega, 2009). In fact, Hunt’s (1965) T-unit and Foster, Tonkyn 
                                                                                             3 
           and Wigglesworth (2000) Analysis of Speech unit (AS-unit) separated independent clauses,
                                                                                              due in part to the overuse of coordinating 
           conjunctions. Coordination of prepositional phrases or noun phrases within a sentence adds complexity, but not clausal complexity 
           because these phrases do not include a verb (Pallotti, 2015). Consequently, the coordination of independent clauses, prepositional 
           phrases, or noun phrases, does not affect the coding of clauses. 
              The coordination of verbal elements, however, can complicate clause coding, despite the well-reasoned guidelines offered by 
           earlier work in the field. Hunt (1965) defined a clause as a finite verb or coordinated verbs (not specifically verb phrases). According to 
           Pallotti (2015), the coordination of verbs (e.g., I sang and danced) does not increase clause complexity because the verbs have a shared 
           subject and seem to reflect a single event. Yet, an implied subject is possible in clauses (e.g., Foster et al., 2000; McManus et al., 2021), 
           and coordinated verb phrases may reflect separate events. For instance, each coordinated verb phrase shown in (1) has its own 
           complement, and they seem to be separate, sequential, events. 
              (1) one night I took my father’s car and went to different city 
              Admittedly, it can be difficult to determine whether the coordinated verb phrases reflect separate events/states. In (2) the coor-
           dinated verb phrases share a subject within a subordinate clause, which muddles whether ‘feel upset’ reflects a separate event than ‘was 
           sad.’ 
              (2) … when I was sad or feel upset4 
              The use of the disjunctive coordinating conjunction (i.e., ‘or’), however, suggests that these are separate events and thus separate 
           clauses despite the shared subject within the adverbial clause. Besides, it would certainly complicate the clause coding for syntactic 
           complexity if the semantics of the conjunction (e.g., ‘or’ vs ‘and’) affects the clause status of coordinated verb phrases. 
            2 
              Any corrections, repetitions, and pausing information were removed from all examples except when that information was relevant to the 
           analysis.  
            3  There are no “compound sentences” when following Hunt (1965) guidelines for T-units or Foster et al.’s (2000) guidelines for AS-units (cf. 
           Hwang et al., 2020).

              This L2 English example also includes a grammatical error; coding complications caused by grammatical errors will be discussed in a later 
           section.

       M. Vercellotti and S. Hall                                                                                                                                                                                            
         Moreover, given the clausal status of sentences without overt subjects in pro-drop languages (e.g., McManus et al., 2021), it seems 
       reasonable that coordinated verb phrases have clause status when each verb has its own complement or adjunct phrase as in (1) and 
       (2), regardless of whether we interpret the verb phrases as separate events. Indeed, some researchers (e.g., Menke, 2024; Vercellotti & 
       Packer, 2016) included coordinated finite verb phrases in their clausal complexity measures, and Foster et al. (2000) went even further 
       by suggesting coordinated verb phrases may be their own “independent” unit in some dialogues. 
         Now that we have established that overt subjects are not required in clauses, we can consider the requirement of conjugation, which 
       is a defining feature of finite clauses. In English, the so-called “future tense” includes a modal and lexical verb, neither marked for tense 
       or subject-verb agreement. In (3), the lexical verbs are unmarked as the coordinated verb phrases share a modal (i.e., ‘would’). 
         (3) she would be very patient and comfort me 
         The verb in the bolded unit retains the clausal feature of having a complement (i.e., me). In fact, the bolded unit in (3) is similar to 
       the bolded unit in (2). In addition, (3) has the same structure as simple English imperatives, which are unequivocally considered 
       clauses. It is unclear how ‘comfort me’ uttered as an imperative could be considered a clause while ‘comfort me’ as part of a coordinated 
       verb phrase would not be considered equally complex. Accordingly, this type of coordinated verb phrase should be counted as a clause, 
       too. Going just a bit further, in (4), the two verbs share a subject (i.e., ‘she’), modal (i.e., ‘will’), and complement (i.e., ‘me’). 
         (4) she will encourage and accompany me… 
         The utterance in (4) may even represent a single event, leaning one to argue that (4) is a single clause. On the other hand, the 
       structure of the bolded unit in (4) is syntactically equivalent to the bolded unit in (3), which has been shown to qualify a clause. Given 
       the similarity of the language produced, a principled coding of clausal complexity includes the coordinated verb phrases of the types 
       shown in (3) and (4) despite lacking an overt subject and tense morphology. 
         Second, nonfinite clauses also lack an overt subject and tense morphology. Since at least Hunt’s (1965) definition of T-units, re-
       searchers (e.g., Menke, 2024; Vajjala & Meurers, 2012) have often limited clauses to finite clauses. In a summary of syntactic 
       complexity indices, Kyle (2016: p. 25) stated “a clause is defined as a subject and a finite verb, though some studies … include clauses 
                                                            ´
       with non-finite verbs.” The contrast in the quote reveals the default status of finite clauses (cf. Bulte & Roothooft, 2020; McManus et al., 
       2021; Vercellotti & Packer, 2016). Importantly, Foster et al. (2000) stated that a nonfinite verb with another element (i.e., complement 
       or adjunct) reaches clause status. The production of another element creates additional complexity on par with finite clauses. 
       Following Foster et al. (2000) coding guidelines, the bolded nonfinite clause in (5) would be coded as a separate clause because the 
       nonfinite verb (i.e., driving) has a complement (i.e., his car). 
         (5) there’s someone driving his car 
         It should be noted that Pallotti (2015) suggested a slightly more demanding criterion, limiting clause status to nonfinite clauses 
       when they denote a different action or state from the main clause. We saw, however, that determining whether the wording denotes 
       separate events can be difficult to ascertain, particularly in an utterance with an existential ‘there,’ as in (5). We argue that the clausal 
       complexity comes from the learner’s production of the additional syntactic element (i.e., a complement or adjunct), and so the bolded 
       construction in (5) is a clause, like the coordinated verb phrases in Examples 1–4. Plus, relying only on the syntactic criterion of having 
       its own complement, facilitates consistent coding. 
         After accepting that nonfinite clauses with another element reaches clause status, the complications continue because nonfinite 
       clauses can also be coordinated. In (6), each nonfinite clause has an overt pronoun complement, but they share the infinitival ‘to’. 
         (6) I hope to meet her and have fun with her again 
         Considering that we have already accepted that modal auxiliaries are not strictly required in coordinated constructions such as in 
       (3) and (4), it is reasonable to count the infinitive constructions in (6) as two separate (nonfinite) clauses because each has its own 
       complement. A pattern emerges that a clause is either a finite verb or a nonfinite verb with a complement or adjunct. 
         Third, we should consider “small clauses” (Basilico, 2003). For instance, ‘I found him fascinating’ is more complex, or at least more 
       sophisticated, than a simple sentence because of the predication relation between “him” and the adjective phrase ‘fascinating’ (Basilico, 
       2005). The bolded verbless small clause in (7) illustrates a similar relationship where ‘them’ is described by the adjective phrase ‘happy’ 
       within a nonfinite clause (i.e., to make them happy). 
         (7) the old people ask me to drink a coffee for them and to make them happy 
         Chen, Alexopoulou and Tsimpli (2021) stated that verbless small clauses are subordinate clauses, but they did not expound with a 
       justification. In contrast, Kubo (1993) argued that these are syntactically noun phrases. As a matter of fact, verbless small clauses, like 
       the bolded words in (7), syntactically resemble non-prototypical noun phrases such as ‘someone new.’ Accordingly, without an overt 
       verb, verbless "small clauses" fail to reach clause status. 
         In contrast, verbal small clauses have an overt verb, albeit one without verbal morphology. In (8), the verb ‘open’ in the small clause 
       has both a subject (i.e., ‘them’) and a complement (i.e., ‘the basket’).

         (8) in the picture number five we can see them just open the basket 
         Although Pallotti (2015) suggested that verbal small clauses do not typically qualify as a clause because the sentence/utterance 
       depicts only one action/event, the bolded verbal small clause in (8) has both a verb and another syntactic element. Therefore, verbal 
       small clauses have similar complexity to other clauses and should be coded as a subordinate clause. 
         In summary, we argue that coordinated verb phrases, nonfinite clauses, and verbal small clauses can reach the complexity of a 
       clause with the learner’s production of another element while verbless small clauses do not. Researchers can recognize these complex 
       clauses as commensurate with finite subordinate clauses by coding them as subordinate clauses. Excluding constructions which are 
       structurally similar to accepted clauses (e.g., imperatives) from the calculations of clauses requires a seemingly arbitrary division along 
       a continuum of complex verbal constructions, which threatens the validity of the clause compleixty measure. 
       Coding complications caused by inaccuracies 
         The grammaticality of L2 language is part of the construct of accuracy, but certain errors can complicate measures of clausal 
       complexity. For instance, the English predicate nominal construction may be produced by learners without a copula (e.g., Tode, 2007). 
       As shown in (9), such utterances successfully describe a state because the copula complement comments on the subject. 
         (9) it different from China 
         If the coding system requires (or depends upon) the production of a verb, utterances like (9) may be inadvertently excluded from 
       the clause calculations. The failure to recognize these clauses would skew measures of clausal complexity, particularly for certain 
       populations, such as learners whose first language does not require the copula in all contexts (e.g., Arabic, Mandarin) and would 
       misrepresent complexity scores of learners from different language backgrounds, coloring comparisons within and across research 
       studies. 
         Furthermore, verb morphology errors are common in L2 production. For instance, for English verbs with aspect, tense is found on 
       the required auxiliary. In (10), it seems as though the learner is attempting to form progressive aspect, but the auxiliary was not 
       produced. 
         (10) so we enjoying the very special very traditional Russian food there 
         Without the required auxiliary, the verb with its -ing morphology may be coded as a participle or gerund, rather than a finite verb. 
       Notably, regardless of the interpretation (nonfinite or finite), it would be coded as a clause following the broader definition of clause 
       presented here. 
         Unfortunately, most research articles (e.g., Kuiken & Vedder, 2011; Leonard & Shea, 2017) do not acknowledge any complications 
       of coding clausal complexity in learner data (cf. Vercellotti, 2017). When investigating the reliability of automatic parsers on advanced 
       L2 written data, Lu (2010) concluded that most inaccuracies did not cause coding errors for the chosen measures. With a corpus of texts 
       written by learners across a range of proficiencies, however, Huang, Murakami, Alexopoulou and Korhonen (2018), found that some 
       verb morphology inaccuracies did cause coding errors by the automated parsers. To address these issues that may thwart clause 
                                                                         ¨ ¨
       identification, researchers must clearly articulate any adjustments made when coding nonstandard forms (Lintunen & Makila, 2014), 
       pre-process the data to improve parser success (e.g., Kim & Lu, 2024), or review part-of-speech tags before the clausal complexity 
       calculations. 
       Complications of speech data 
         L2 speaking generally requires more cognitive resources than writing (Hwang, Jung & Kim, 2020), and there is pressure to maintain 
       the speech stream (Kuiken & Vedder, 2011). As a result, speech data tend to have more language errors than written texts, increasing 
       the coding complications discussed in the previous section. Additionally, speech data have more “noise” such as repetitions and false 
       starts (Kim & Lu, 2024). Foster et al. (2000) defined the AS-unit with consideration of many complications of segmenting spoken data, 
       including the frequent use of transition words. Despite their guidance, complications still arise from the extensive linking of ideas, 
       which is more common in speech, as shown in (11). 
         (11) if I work hard or if I think hard or if I do stuff and work more I’ll get more money 
         The utterance begins with three coordinated subordinate clauses beginning with ‘if’, and it is difficult to decide if the speaker 
       intended a list of events or if the speaker was trying various options to express the same idea (i.e., self-correcting). Certainly, grammar 
       and lexical corrections are common in speech (Vercellotti & McCormick, 2018). If this utterance had been written with the opportunity 
       to be edited, perhaps the first two clauses would have been replaced by the third. Given that each clause is fully grammatical and there 
       is no clear lexical substitution, each could be intended, and therefore, plausibly coded as separate clauses. The next example illustrates 
       an even bigger challenge. The utterance in (11) was followed by the utterance in (12), which includes the non-lexical filled pause uh 
       and silent pauses marked with (.).

             M. Vercellotti and S. Hall                                                                                                                                                                                            
                 (12) and that (.) that which (.) uh (.) make it a good (.) job for me (.) 
                 Even with the additional pausing (and intonation) information available in speech data, it is unclear whether the speaker is self- 
             correcting or adding clauses. When coding clauses in data with superfluous connector words, corrections, and errors, such as the 
             utterances shown in (11) and (12), researchers should acknowledge any systematic complications and resolutions in the methodology 
             section. 
                 The final complication to (briefly) address is the finite clause type which takes an entire clause as its linguistic complement (e.g., 
             direct object), as shown in (13). 
                                    5 
                 (13) uh (.) I think (.) uh (.) we should (.) uh (.) uh (.) do some protection to: (.) protect our (.) world (.) 
                                                                                                                                      ´
                 These clauses are likely to be matrix verbs when in initial position and with the complementizer ‘that’ (Dehe & Wichmann, 2010). 
                                                                                                                                    ´
             However, ‘I think’ and other “minor clauses” (Fung & Carter, 2007) can express epistemic stance (Brown, Fernandez & Huensch, 2023), 
                                                                    ´
             similar to adverbs such as ‘maybe’ or ‘possibly’. Dehe and Wichmann (2010) have convincingly argued that when used in medial or final 
             position, ‘I think” functions as a (grammaticalized) adverb. Hence, the ‘I think” in (14) is emblematic of its use as an epistemic hedge. 
                 (14) and (.) you know you can because (.) because every team I think should have a (.) good leader (.) like that (.) 
                 Certainly, it is difficult to differentiate between the use of ‘I think’ as an epistemic hedge and a matrix verb of cognition. Given the 
             frequency of this verb (Vercellotti, Juffs & Naismith, 2021), particularly with topic prompts which ask for an opinion, researchers 
             should recognize how these clauses inflate the number of clauses while lowering the mean length of clause. Given their syntactic 
                                                                                         ´
             structure, such clauses are clauses; however, some studies (e.g., Dehe & Wichmann, 2010; Vercellotti & Packer, 2016) have coded 
             these clauses separately from matrix clauses, which allows them to be tallied and analyzed separately if warranted. 
             Conclusion 
                 This commentary has demonstrated that some verbal constructions beyond the prototypical clause demonstrate clausal properties 
             and comparable syntactic complexity to finite clauses. Accordingly, the term clause should be expanded to include verb phrases and 
             nonfinite clauses with another syntactic element. Including verb phrases with a complement and/or adjunct as a separate clause is 
             justified given the structural similarity (and thus similar level of complexity) with imperatives, which are accepted as clauses. The 
             explicit inclusion of verb phrases with a complement/adjunct in the clause coding allows for consistency across studies, including 
             research with certain L2 English learners (e.g., those with a pro-drop language background) who might fail to produce a subject as well 
             as research with L2 learners of pro-drop languages. 
                 Additionally, the field should recognize nonfinite clauses as subordinate clauses, finally adopting the suggestion that Foster et al. 
             (2000) made nearly a quarter of a century ago. Giving clause status to nonfinite clauses may also mitigate confusion caused by missing 
             or superfluous verbal morphology in learner data. Likewise, a clause which lacks a copula but clearly describes a state should be 
             considered a clause, which is often grammatically acceptable cross-linguistically. In summary, the definition of clause in L2 research 
             should include:  
              • verb phrases with a complement and/or adjunct, such as (1) and (2)  
                 ○ 
                   including verb phrases with a shared modal, such as (3) and (4)  
              • nonfinite clauses with a complement and/or adjunct, such as (5)  
                 ○  including nonfinite clauses with a shared infinitival ‘to,’ such as (6)  
                 ○ 
                   including verbal small clauses, such as (8)  
              • copula constructions without the copula, such as (9) 
                 This definition, supported by previous work in the field, is syntactic, and each of the above would be subordinate clauses in the 
             complexity calculations. Verbless small clauses, such as (7), however, would be excluded from the definition of clause. To supplement 
             the examples discussed above, Appendix A shows a coded transcript of a speech produced by a low-advanced English learner. The 
             coding advocated here results in 23 clauses in thirteen AS-units (1.77 clauses/AS-unit), reflecting that many of the AS-units were multi- 
             clausal. 
                 Further, having this default definition of clause replaces a potentially lengthy description of what verbal constructions were 
             included in the coding scheme. If a researcher decides to operationalize clause more narrowly, which may be appropriate either 
             theoretically or for practicality, they can report the inclusion criteria briefly, such as “finite clauses with an overt subject.” As a point of 
             comparison, if the transcript in Appendix A were coded following a narrower definition, only 15 (bolded) clauses would be coded, and 
             the same speech would seem to have few multi-clausal AS-units (1.15 clauses/AS-unit). 
                 Although the examples described here reflect issues that emerged from just one data set, it is likely that all L2 data have some of 
              5                                                                                                                  ´
                 In addition, ‘I think’ may sometimes serve as a verbal filler and a repair strategy in speech (Brown et al, 2023; Dehe & Wichmann, 2010). In (13) 
             the ‘I think’ may be used for fluency as it begins with a non-lexical filler, a pause, and another non-lexical filler before offering an opinion.

           these complex (but often excluded) clauses and some difficult-to-code clauses. The field’s acceptance of this broader definition of clause 
           will facilitate the interpretation of research findings on a range of syntactic complexity measures, including the commonly used 
           measures of mean clause length and clauses per sentential unit. Clarity in the research methodology enables readers to better interpret 
           findings. A clear, shared, definition of clause also allows better comparison of results across studies. We ask the field to use this justified, 
           broader definition of clause, and we invite the field to continue discussing coding complications found in L2 data.
