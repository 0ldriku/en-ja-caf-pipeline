a boy is blowing bubbles by the tree
he is very he's having a lot of fun
and is being very excited
blowing all sorts of intricate bubbles
he blows out a very long bubble
and then it transforms to a snake
snake looks at him very angrily
looking like
he is about to attack him
the boy then blows out another huge bubble
now comes a tiger
the tiger is attacking the snake
now the boy once again blows a very bubble
and now comes an elephant in front of the tiger
the boy seems very happy with all the animals
that he has made
the boy yet blows another bubble
and all the animal bubbles
that he has blown before
seem to run away
the boy then pops all the bubbles in the air
then drops all the liquid soap onto the ground
leaving his place
as he walks aw as he walks away
another animal made of bubbles emerges from the soap puddle
that he made
